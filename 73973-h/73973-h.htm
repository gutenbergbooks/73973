<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">For</span> seven weeks Nell Llewellyn fluctuated
between life and death before she was fully
roused again to a sense of living and its
cares and responsibilities. It was on a
sunny afternoon, in the middle of October,
that she first awoke to the consciousness
that she was herself. But she was too
weak to do more than be aware of it. The
afternoon sun was glinting through the
white blind of her bedroom window, and a
little breeze caused it to flap gently against
the latticed panes. Nell lay on her bed,
as weak and unreasoning and incurious as
a little child, and watched the tassel of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
blind bobbing up and down, without questioning
why she lay there, unable to move
or think. An old woman named Betsy
Hobbs, who came in sometimes to help in
an emergency at the farmhouse, was seated
by the window, with a large pair of knitting-needles
in her hands, a ball of worsted at
her feet, and her head sunk on her breast,
enjoying a snooze after the labours of the
day. Nell stared at her unfamiliar figure
with the same sense of incapacity to understand
her presence, and the same sense of
utter indifference to not understanding it.
Her feeble sight roved over everything in
the room with the same apathy. The
coverlet on her bed was a coloured one,
and she kept on counting the squares and
wondering in a vague manner why one
should be red and the next blue. One
red, and the next <span class="lock">blue—one</span> red, and the
next <span class="lock">blue—she</span> kept on mentally repeating
to herself, until her eyes had travelled to
the foot of the bed, over the footboard of
which was thrown a pink knitted shawl,
or kerchief, which her mother had bought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
for her just before she was taken ill, and
which she had worn around her shoulders
on the evening she had gone to hear Hugh
Owen preach in the field. That little link
between the past and the present recalled
it all. In a moment she comprehended.
She was no longer happy, innocent Nell
Llewellyn, spending her young life at Panty-cuckoo
Farm, but the disgraced and degraded
daughter of the house, who had
crept home, a living lie, to hide her shame
and sorrow in her mother’s bosom. The
remembrance brought with it but one desire—one
want—which expressed itself in a
feeble cry of ‘Mother!’ At least, it was
what Nell intended for a cry; but her voice
was so faint and weak, that Betsy Hobbs
only roused from her nap with a feeling
of curiosity if she <em>had</em> heard anything. She
was accustomed to nursing the sick, however,
and was a light sleeper, so she
hobbled up to the bedside and peered
into her patient’s face. Sure enough her
eyes were open and there was reason in
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>‘Praise the Lord, dearie,’ she ejaculated,
‘you’re yourself agin at last!’</p>

<p>But Nell turned her face to the wall with
the same cry of ‘Mother!’</p>

<p>‘To be sure, dearie; and I’ll fetch ’er in
’alf a minnit. She’s only stepped down to
the dairy to see ’ow things are goin’ on,
for business ’as been sadly neglected of
late. Night and <span class="lock">day—night</span> and day—the
pore dear’s bin by your side, longin’ to
’ear your own voice agin, and she’ll be overj’yed
to find you in your senses. Come,
drink a drop o’ milk, do, and then I’ll
fetch ’er.’</p>

<p>But Nell turned fractiously from the
proffered cup and reiterated her cry for
her mother. She was gaunt and emaciated
to a degree. The cruel fever had wasted
her rounded limbs, and dug deep furrows
beneath her eyes, and turned her delicate
complexion to yellow and brown. She
looked like a woman of forty or fifty,
instead of a girl of three-and-twenty.
As the old woman ambled out of the
room, Nell raised her thin hands and gazed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
at the white nails and bony knuckles with
amazement. Where had she been? What
had happened to her, to alter her like
that? Her questions were answered by
the entrance of Mrs Llewellyn.</p>

<p>‘Oh, my dear <span class="lock">lass—my</span> own poor lamb!’
she exclaimed, as she came hurriedly to
the bedside, and folded her daughter in
her arms. ‘Praise the Lord that you have
taken a turn at last! I’ve been watching
for this days and days, till I began to
fear it might never be. You’ve been main
ill, my girl, and all the house nursing you
through it. Father’s lying down on his
bed. He hasn’t had his coat off for three
nights. But you’re better, my lass, you’re
better, thank God for that!’</p>

<p>‘How long have I been ill?’ asked Nell
in a faint voice.</p>

<p>‘Better than six <span class="lock">weeks—going</span> on for
seven,’ replied her mother; ‘and it’s been
an anxious time for all of us. I thought
poor Hetty would have cried herself sick
last week, when Dr Cowell told us we
mustn’t build our hopes too much on keeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
you here. I think he will be as
surprised as anyone when he hears the
good news. Oh, my lass, it would have
been a sore day for more than one of us
if we had lost you!’</p>

<p>‘I may go yet, mother,’ said Nell, looking
at her skeleton hands; ‘there’s not much of
me left, I’m thinking.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no you won’t, my dear, not this
time, thank God. I know what these fevers
are. I’ve seen too many of them. When
they’ve burnt themselves out, they’re over.
And you’re as cool as a cucumber now.
You feel terrible weak, I know, but good
feeding and care will soon set you up
again.’</p>

<p>‘What a trouble I must have been to
you,’ sighed Nell wearily; ‘and so unworthy
of it too. Mother, why didn’t you let me
die, and make an end of it? Life is not
worth living at any time, and I’ve seen the
best of mine.’</p>

<p>‘Nonsense, my girl, you talk like that
because you’re so weak, that’s all. You’ll
feel quite different in another day or so.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
Here, just let me give you a few spoonfuls
of this beef-tea. I made it myself, so I
won’t take a refusal. There’s a good maid,
and now you must shut your eyes and go
to sleep again.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t leave me,’ murmured Nell, as she
lay with her hand clasped in her mother’s.
‘Talk to me, mother. Tell me you are
really glad that I am better, and I will try
to live for your sake.’</p>

<p>‘Glad, child! Why, what are you thinking
of? Glad to get my own lass back
from the grave, as you may say? I should
be a nice mother if I weren’t. Don’t you
know by this time that you’ve been my
hope and pride ever since you was born?
Why, I’ve been praying night and day
to the Lord to spare you for weeks past.
Ay, and not only me; all Usk has been
asking the same thing, and there’s been one
in particular as has wearied Heaven with
prayers for your recovery, if ever man did.’</p>

<p>‘<em>One in particular?</em>’ echoed the sick girl
faintly curious. ‘Who was that, mother?’</p>

<p>‘Why, that young saint on earth, Hugh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Owen, to be sure. I never saw a man so
unhappy as he’s been about you. He looks
ten years older since you were taken ill.
Do you know, Nell, that he’s been here
every minute he could spare from his work,
kneeling by your bedside whilst you were
raving in delirium, praying with all his heart
and soul, that God would spare your precious
life to us a little longer. Hugh Owen
has been your tenderest nurse. I’ve seen
him sit here, without saying a word for
hours together, only holding you in his arms
when you got a bit violent, and coaxing
you by every means in his power to take
a drop of wine or a spoonful of jelly. I do
believe that you owe your life in a great
measure to Hugh’s care (and so I’ve told
father that if you lived, it would be), for
though we all tried our best, no one has
had so much influence over you as him, or
been able to make you take nourishment
like he could.’</p>

<p>‘Did he hear me talk?’ asked Nell,
fearfully.</p>

<p>‘Hear you talk, child? Well, pretty nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
all Usk heard you talk, you used to scream
so loud sometimes. But it was all nonsense.
No one could understand it, so you needn’t
be afraid you told any of your little secrets.
I couldn’t make head nor tail of what you
said, nor Hugh either. But his presence
seemed to comfort you, so I let the poor
lad have his way. He was nearly broken-hearted
when he left the farm last night,
you were so terribly weak and low. I
expect he’ll nearly go out of his mind when
he hears the news I shall have to tell him
this evening. He’ll offer up a grand prayer
of thanksgiving before he goes to his bed
to-night.’</p>

<p>But at this juncture, seeing that Nell’s
weary eyes had closed again, Mrs Llewellyn
covered her carefully with the bedclothes,
and went to communicate the fact of her
improvement to the farmer. As the husband
and wife were sitting at their evening meal,
Hugh Owen, as usual, walked in. His face
was very pale, and his expression careworn.
His first anxious inquiry was naturally for
Nell. When he heard the great improvement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
that had taken place in her, and that
Doctor Cowell had said at his last visit that
she was now on the road to recovery, his
pallid cheeks glowed with excitement.</p>

<p>‘God Almighty be thanked for all His
goodness!’ he said solemnly, and then added
rapidly,—‘May I see her, Mrs Llewellyn?
Just for one moment. I will not speak to
her, if you do not think it desirable, but
to see her once more sensible and in her
right mind would make me so happy. I
shall hardly be able to believe the joyful
news is true otherwise.’</p>

<p>The mother looked doubtful.</p>

<p>‘Well, I don’t quite know how Nell
would take it, my lad. You’ve been main
good to her, I know; but it wouldn’t do
to upset her now, and you would be the
last to wish it.’</p>

<p>‘Upset her! Oh, no; but I have sat
by her so often during her illness.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, when she wasn’t aware of your
presence; that makes all the difference.
But,’ noting the look of disappointment in
the young man’s face, she added, ‘I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
just step up and see how matters are
now; and if Nell’s sleeping you shall
have a peep at her, in return for all your
goodness.’</p>

<p>The young man thanked her, and in
a few minutes she came back to say that
her daughter was fast asleep, and, if
Hugh would follow her, he should see
so for himself. He rose at once, his face
radiant with joy, and crept on tip-toe up
the stairs and into the familiar bedroom.
There lay Nell, prostrate in the sleep of
exhaustion—her hands folded together on
the coverlet, her head well back on her
pillow, her mouth slightly parted, her
breathing as regular and calm as that of
an infant. At the sight Hugh’s eyes
filled with tears.</p>

<p>‘Doesn’t she look as if she were praying—thanking
God for His goodness to
her?’ he whispered to Mrs Llewellyn.
‘Oh, let us pray too. We can never
thank Him enough for all He has done
for us.’</p>

<p>And he fell on his knees by the bedside,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
Mrs Llewellyn following his example.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Father, God, Protector, Friend,’
said the young man, with tears running
down his worn cheeks, ‘what can we
render to Thee for all Thou art to us,
for all Thou doest for us? We have
cried to Thee in our distress, and Thou
hast heard our cry. We wept in our
abject fear of loss, and Thou hast dried
our tears. Thou hast sent Thy messenger
angels, with healing in their wings,
to succour this dear child of Thine—this
dear companion of <span class="lock">ours—and</span> give
her and us alike time to do something
to prove the sense of gratitude we have
for Thy great love to us. Oh, Father,
make us more grateful, more thankful,
more resolved to live the lives which
Thou hast given us, to Thee, more careful
of the beautiful, earthly love with which
Thou hast brightened and made happy
these lives. Amen.’</p>

<p>No one could mistake the earnestness
and fervour and genuineness of this address,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
which Hugh delivered as simply as
if he had been speaking to his earthly
father in his earthly home. Mrs Llewellyn
could not restrain mingling her tears with
his. She told the farmer afterwards that
Hugh’s way of praying made her feel as
if the Almighty were standing just beside
them where they knelt. Softly as the
young minister had preferred his petition,
it seemed to have reached the sleeper’s
ear, even through her dreams, for as his
‘Amen’ fell on the air, Nell opened her
eyes and said very softly,—</p>

<p>‘Thank you, Hugh.’</p>

<p>The sound of her voice, and the assurance
that his presence had not disturbed
her, so moved his sensitive disposition
that he sprung forward, and, sinking again
upon his knees by her side, raised her
thin hand to his lips and kissed it several
times in succession, whilst his dark eyes
glowed with feeling.</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ again sighed Nell. ‘Good-night.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, my lad, it must be good-night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
for you mustn’t stay here!’ exclaimed
Mrs Llewellyn, who was fearful of the
effects of any agitation on her invalid.
‘You’ve had your wish and seen Nell,
and you’ve prayed a beautiful prayer, and
now you must come back to the parlour
with me and have a bit of supper. Go
down to the kitchen, Betsy,’ she continued
to the old nurse, ‘and get our Nell another
drop of beef-tea, and I’ll be up to see
after her as soon as the table’s cleared.
Bless her heart! if she isn’t off again.
She’ll want all the sleep she can get now,
to make up for the sore time she’s passed
through. Come, Hugh.’</p>

<p>But the young minister refused all her
offers of hospitality. He felt as if food
would choke him just then. He wanted
to be alone to think of his great and
unexpected <span class="lock">joy—to</span> thank the Giver of it
over and over again. He walked home
through the crisp October evening, wandering
far afield, in order to commune
with his own thoughts, and enlarging the
prayer of thankfulness, with which his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
heart was bursting, by another petition,
that God, who had given this woman
back to him and her friends, would give
her to him also and altogether as his wife.</p>

<p>He did not see Nell again during the
period of convalescence that she spent in
her own room. But not one day passed
without his presence at the farm and his
thoughts of her being brought to her
notice by some little offering from his
hands. One day it would be a bunch of
glowing chrysanthemums, from the deepest
bronze to the palest pink and purest
white. The next, he brought a basket
of <span class="lock">fruit—a</span> cluster of hothouse grapes—to
get which he had walked for miles,
or a bunch of bananas, or anything which
was considered a dainty in Usk. Once
he sent her a few verses of a hymn,
neatly copied out on fair paper; but these
Nell put on one side with a smile which
savoured of contempt. She was now
fairly on the road for recovery; and even
Hetty, who had been going backwards
and forwards every day, began to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
the walk from Dale Farm was rather long,
and that her mother-in-law needed a little
more of her company. The services of
the doctor and old Betsy Hobbs were
dispensed with, and Mrs Llewellyn found
there was no longer any necessity for her
to leave all the churning and baking to
her farm maids, but that she could
devote the usual time to them herself.
It was an accredited fact that Nell had
been snatched from the jaws of death,
and that her relatives need have no more
fears on her account. Still Hugh Owen
continued to pay her his daily attentions,
till she, like women courted by men for
whom they have no fancy, began to weary
of seeing the flowers and fruit and books
coming in every afternoon, and to cast
them somewhat contemptuously aside. It
was a grand day at Panty-cuckoo Farm
when she first came down the stairs,
supported by her father and mother—very
shaky and weak, but really well
again, and saying good-bye to bed in the
daytime for good and all. Mrs Llewellyn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
was a proud and happy woman when
she saw her daughter installed on the
solitary sofa which the house could boast
of, swathed round in shawls and blankets,
and a very ghost of her former self, but
yet alive, and only needing time to make
her strong again.</p>

<p>‘Well, my dear lass,’ she said, as she
helped Nell to her cup of tea, ‘I never
thought at one time to see you on that
sofa again, nor downstairs at all, except
it was in your coffin. You’ve got a lot
to be thankful for, Nell; it’s not many
constitutions that could have weathered
such an illness.’</p>

<p>Nell sipped the tea she held in her
hand, and wondered what was the use
of coming back to a world that didn’t
want her, and which she didn’t want.
But she was still too weak to argue, even
if she would have argued such a subject
with her mother. As the meal was in
the course of progress a gentle tap
sounded on the outer door.</p>

<p>‘Now, I’ll bet that’s Hugh Owen, dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
lad!’ exclaimed Mrs Llewellyn briskly, as
she rose to answer it. ‘He’ll be main
pleased and surprised to see our Nell
downstairs. He’s been so curious to hear
when the doctor would let her get up,
and I wouldn’t tell him, just to keep
him a bit in suspense.’</p>

<p>She opened the door as she spoke,
calling out,—</p>

<p>‘How are ye, Hugh, my lad? Come
in, do. We’ve got company to tea to-night,
and you’re heartily welcome.’</p>

<p>But Hugh shrunk back.</p>

<p>‘I won’t disturb you if you’ve company,
Mrs Llewellyn,’ he said. ‘I only stepped
over to hear how your daughter is this
evening, and to ask her acceptance of
these,’ and he shyly held out a bouquet
of hot-house flowers.</p>

<p>‘Eh, Hugh, but they’re very beautiful.
Wherever did you get them?’ said Mrs
Llewellyn.</p>

<p>‘I’ve a friend in the florist way up by
Pontypool,’ he answered, ‘and I thought
Nell might like them to make her room gay.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>‘To be sure she will, and give you
many thanks in return. Come in and
give them her yourself.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, may I?’ said Hugh, as he walked
gladly over the threshold and saw Nell
lying on the couch and holding out an
attenuated hand to him.</p>

<p>She looked thinner even than when she
had been confined to bed. People do, as
a rule, when they first come downstairs.
Her cheeks were sunken and white as
death itself, and her eyes seemed preternaturally
large and staring. But it was
Nell, and Hugh Owen’s face grew scarlet
at the mere sight of her.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Nell!’ he exclaimed, as he advanced
quickly to grasp her outstretched
hand, ‘this <em>is</em> a joyful surprise to see
you downstairs again. Your mother
had not prepared me for it. Are you
sure you feel none the worse for the
exertion—that it will not do you any
harm?’</p>

<p>Nell was about to reply, but Mrs
Llewellyn anticipated her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>‘Now, my lad!’ she exclaimed, rather
tartly, ‘don’t you make a fool of yourself.
You don’t suppose, do you, that I
would let my lass injure her health after
all the trouble and anxiety we’ve had on
her account, by letting her do anything
rash? Don’t you make any mistake about
it, Hugh. What Nell’s mother don’t foresee
for her, no one else will, let alone
a stripling like yourself.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mrs Llewellyn!’ exclaimed the
young man, turning all kinds of colours,
‘I am sure you must <span class="lock">know—you</span> cannot
think that I would <span class="lock">presume—who</span> knows
better than I, how you have nursed and
watched over her? Only I—I—the
natural anxiety, you know—’</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes, my lad, I know all about it.
You needn’t stammer in that fashion, nor
take the trouble to explain, and I’ve no
call to find fault with you either, for
you’ve been the kindest friend poor Nell
has had in her sickness, and the most
thoughtful, not excepting her own sister.
But don’t fear but what she’s well looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
after, though I hope the day’s not far
distant now when she’ll look after herself.’</p>

<p>‘And so do I,’ said young Owen.
‘You’re looking bravely, Nell, considering
what you’ve gone through. It’s been
a sore time with you. Please God it
may be the last.’</p>

<p>‘Mother tells me you’ve been very
good to me through it all, Hugh,’ replied
Nell, in a low voice, ‘and prayed
for my recovery scores of times. You
meant it kindly, I know, though perhaps
whilst you were about it, it would
have been better to have asked the Lord
to let me go.’</p>

<p>Mrs Llewellyn, seeing Nell was in good
hands, had wandered away after some
of her household arrangements, and left
them by themselves.</p>

<p>‘No, Nell, no; not whilst He has work
for you to do here, and permits you to remain.
Besides, think what a grief it would
have been to your father and mother and
sister—and to me, if you had died. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
could not have easily filled your place,
Nell. You mustn’t be sorry because you
have been spared to make us happy.
And why should you want to go so
soon? You are young and beautiful—you
don’t mind an old friend like me
telling you that, do you?—and have all
your life before you. It is unnatural that
you should be loath to live. It can only
be your extreme weakness that makes you
say so.’</p>

<p>‘If you knew me better, Hugh, you would
not talk like that. My life is <span class="lock">past—not</span> to
come—and there seems nothing (that I can
see) for me to do. I don’t want to look
back, and the future is a <span class="lock">blank—a</span> dark,
horrible uncertainty, in which I can discern
no good in living. I shall help mother in the
farmhouse work, of course, now I have come
home, but it will not be any pleasure to me.
It is so different from what I have been accustomed
to, and when all’s said and done
a dairymaid would do it far better than I.
I have grown beyond it, in fact (though
you mustn’t tell mother I said so for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
all the world), and <span class="lock">so—and</span> <span class="lock">so—I</span> think
you are my friend, Hugh, and I tell you
the truth—I would have much rather
died.’</p>

<p>The young man looked distressed. He
guessed there was more behind this statement
than Nell would confess. But he
replied to her appeal energetically.</p>

<p>‘Your friend, Nell. You may do more
than <em>think</em> it. You may regard it as an
undoubted fact. I only wish I could, or I
dared make you understand how much I am
your friend. And as for there being no work
for you to do, except household drudgery,
oh! if you will listen to me, I can tell you of
glorious work that lies close to your hand—work
that would bring you both peace and
happiness. Will you let me show it you,
dear Nell? Will you listen to me whilst I
point it out to you?’</p>

<p>‘Another time, Hugh. Not just now,
thank you, for my brain is still too weak to
understand half I hear. When I am stronger,
and able to take an interest in things again,
you shall talk to me as much as you like,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
for I am very grateful to you for all your
goodness to me, and shall be glad to return
it in any way I can.’</p>

<p>So Hugh left her with a heart brimming
over with content, and a great hope springing
up in it for the future.</p>

</div>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Such</span> of the villagers of Usk who met
Hugh Owen during the few days that succeeded
this interview spoke to each other
with surprise of the alteration that had taken
place in his demeanour. The sober, grave,
young minister, who had seldom smiled, and
usually appeared too wrapped in his own
thoughts to take much part in what went on
before him, was now to be seen with a
beaming countenance and an animated welcome
for all whom he met.</p>

<p>‘Why, farmer,’ quoth one worthy to Mr
Owen, ‘but what’s come to yon lad of yourn,
the minister? Is he going to be elected an
elder, or is he thinking of getting spliced?’</p>

<p>‘Spliced!’ roared the farmer, who, notwithstanding
his pride in his learning and
attainments, cherished rather a mean opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
of his eldest son as a man. ‘<em>Spliced</em>! the
Lord save us, no! Where would Hugh
get the courage to ask a lass to have him?
He can’t so much as look them in the face;
and when his mother or Hetty brings one of
the neighbours’ girls in for a bit of a talk,
he sneaks out at the back door with his
tail between his legs, for all the world like a
kicked cur. Married! Hugh will never be
married. He wouldn’t know what to do
with a wife if he’d got one, not he. He’s a
minister, is <span class="lock">Hugh—just</span> that and nothing
more. What makes you ask such a thing,
Ben?’</p>

<p>‘Why because I met him near Thomson’s
patch this afternoon, with his mouth one
grin, and talking to himself as if he was
preaching.</p>

<p>‘“Why minister,” I says, “are you making
up your next sermon?” and he says, “No,
Ben,” he says, “I’m trying over a thanksgiving
service for myself.” And he smiled
as if someone had left him a fortune.’</p>

<p>‘And yesterday,’ interposed a woman,
‘when my little Nan ran across the road and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
fell down, and whimpered a bit, as children
will, Hugh he was after her in a minute,
and picked her up, and there he <em>did</em> kiss
her as I never see. Nan, she didn’t know
what to make of it, and stopped crying from
sheer surprise, and when I called out, “That’s
right, minister, nothing like getting your
hand in for nursing,” he reddened. Lor’!
just like my turkey-cock when the lads
throw stones at him.’</p>

<p>‘Well, my woman, you needn’t think he’s
going to nurse any of his own for all that.
Hugh is too much of a scholar to bear the
noise of children in the house. If Hetty
ever gets any little ones I expect he’ll find
another place for himself. He said the other
night that the old farm would never seem
like the same again if there was babies
in it.’</p>

<p>‘He’s up a deal at Panty-cuckoo, I hear,’
said the first speaker.</p>

<p>‘Oh, ay. That’s all in his own line,’
replied the farmer. ‘The poor lass up
there has been mortal <span class="lock">bad—nearly</span> dead,
by my missus’s <span class="lock">account—and</span> Hugh’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
been praying with her and for her, and
such like. And his prayers have been
heard, it seems, for my daughter-in-law
says her sister is downstairs again, and
in a fair way to mend. I expect she
brought the fever from London town
with her. We’re not used to have such
fads in Usk. A young lass stricken down
like an old woman. ’Twas an ugly sight,
and I’m main glad, for the Llewellyns’
sake, as she’s been spared. ’Twould have
been a sad coming-home else.’</p>

<p>‘That it would,’ said his friend Ben.
‘And I expect it was thinking over the
prayers he has put up for her as made
the minister so smiling this afternoon.
Well, he have cause to be proud, and
he do pray beautiful, to be sure. My old
woman say he bawl them so loud, that if
the Lord can’t hear <em>him</em> it’s no manner
of use any of us trying for ourselves.
Well, morning to ye, farmer,’ and off
went Ben on his own business.</p>

<p>Hugh Owen would not have been
over-pleased could he have heard them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
discussing his private feelings after this
fashion; but, luckily for him, he did not
hear them. It is lucky for all of us
when we do not hear what our neighbours
say of us behind our backs. We
should not have an acquaintance left in
the world if we did. But the young
minister went on his way, little dreaming
that anyone guessed the sweet, sacred
hope which he was cherishing in his
heart of hearts, and which he only
waited for Nell’s complete convalescence
to confide to her. The time for doing
so arrived (for him) only too soon, and
often afterwards he wished he had been
content to nurse his love for her in
secret.</p>

<p>It was one day when she was downstairs
again, looking so much older since
her illness that people who had only
known her in London would hardly have
recognised her, that Hugh asked Nell if
she would grant him an hour’s conversation.
Even then she did not think the
request was made for more than friendship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
for she had spoken to Hugh Owen
of her desire to train herself for better
things than farm work, that she might
be able, perhaps, to keep a comfortable
home for her parents when they were
past labour. This appeared to Nell the
only ambition that could give her any
interest in life <span class="lock">again—the</span> idea that she
would repay in some measure her father’s
and mother’s great love for her. Hugh
might have thought of something, or
heard of something, so she granted him
the interview he asked for gladly, and
received him with a kind smile and
an outstretched hand, which he grasped
eagerly and detained long.</p>

<p>‘You are quite well again now, Nell,’
he said, as he looked into her face,
which was still so beautiful, though pale
and worn.</p>

<p>‘Yes, quite well, Hugh, thank you,’
she replied. ‘I walked across the Park
this morning to see Sir Archibald’s old
housekeeper, Mrs Hody, and had quite a
long chat with her. The family is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
coming down for Christmas this year, she
tells me, but have put it off till the cub-hunting
begins, and then the Hall will
be full. She gave me a clutch of golden
pheasants’ eggs. I am going to set them
under one of our hens. Don’t you like
golden pheasants, Hugh? I think they
are such lovely creatures.’</p>

<p>‘I like and admire all God’s creatures,
Nell, and cannot understand anyone doing
otherwise. I well remember your love
for animals as a child, and how you
smacked my face once for putting your
kitten up on the roof of the stable, where
she couldn’t get down.’</p>

<p>‘Did I? That was very rude. But
I’m afraid, from what I can remember,
that I always treated you rather badly,
poor Hugh, and encroached upon your
kindness to me. You have always
been kind to me, and lately most of
all. Mother believes I owe my life to
you.’</p>

<p>‘No, no, Nell, you owe it to the dear
God, Who would not see us all plunged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
into despair by your loss—<em>I</em> most of all.
But if you really think you owe me ever
so little, you can return it a hundredfold,
if you will.’</p>

<p>Nell turned towards him eagerly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Hugh, how? Tell me, and I
will do it. Don’t think I have so many
friends that I can afford to undervalue
your friendship. I have very few friends,
Hugh—very, <em>very</em> few,’ said the girl, with
a quivering lip.</p>

<p>‘How can you repay me?’ repeated the
young man, musingly. ‘Is it possible
you do not guess? Nell, do you know,
have you ever thought why I lead such a
lonely life, why I have not married like
Will? My brother is five years younger
than myself, and most of the lads in Usk
are thinking of getting a wife as soon as
they can make their pound or thirty
shillings a week. I make four times that
as a minister, Nell, and most girls would
think me well able to keep them in comfort
and respectability. Yet I have never
given a thought to one of them—<em>why</em>?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>‘Because you’re a minister, I suppose,’
replied Nell, ‘and all your mind is set
upon your chapel and sermons and the
open-air preaching. Isn’t that it?’ with a
shy glance upwards to see how he took
the suggestion. But Hugh only sighed
and turned away.</p>

<p>‘No, no; why should that be it? Because
I’m a minister, and want to do all
I can for God whilst I live, am I the less a
man with less of a man’s cravings for love
and companionship? No, Nell, there is a
reason for it, but a very different one
from what you imagine. The reason I
have never given a thought to marriage
yet is because when I was a lanky, awkward
lad, there was a little maid whom
I used to call my <span class="lock">sweetheart—who</span> used
to let me carry her over the boulders in
the river, to go with her black-berrying,
to walk beside her as she went to and
came from church. Though, as we grew
up, I was separated from that little maid,
Nell, I never forgot her, and I never shall.
No other will take her place with me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t say that, Hugh, pray don’t
say that!’ cried Nell, with visible agitation.
‘You mustn’t! It is folly—worse
than folly, for that little maid will never
be yours <span class="lock">again—never</span>, never!’</p>

<p>She uttered the last words with so deep
a sigh that it sounded almost like a
requiem over her departed, innocent childhood.
But Hugh would not accept it
as such.</p>

<p>‘But why, dear Nell?’ he questioned.
‘We have met again, and we are both
free. What objection can there be to
our marriage, if <em>you</em> have none? I would
not hurry you. You should name your
own time, only let us be engaged. I have
told you that I can keep you in comfort,
and if parting with your parents is an
obstacle, I’ll consent to anything you
think best. Only don’t send me away
without hope. You will take all the spirit
out of my life and work if you do. I
think your people like <span class="lock">me—I</span> don’t anticipate
any trouble with them, but the
word that is to make me happy must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
come from <em>your</em> lips, <span class="lock">Nell—from</span> yours
alone!’</p>

<p>‘It can never come from them,’ answered
Nell sadly.</p>

<p>‘Don’t say that, my little sweetheart
of olden days. Oh, Nell, if you only
knew, if I could only make you understand
how I have kept your image in my
heart all these years, how your face has
come between me and my duties, till I’ve
had to drive it away by sheer force of
will. When I found you had come back
to Usk, I thought God had sent you
expressly for me. Don’t say now, after
all my hopes and longings to meet you
again—after you have come back from
the grave to me, Nell—don’t say, for
God’s sake, that it has been all in
vain!’</p>

<p>He bowed his head upon his outstretched
arm as he spoke, and Nell
knew, though she could not see, that he
was weeping.</p>

<p>‘What can I say to you, Hugh,’ she
began, after a pause. ‘I <em>do</em> love you for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
all your goodness to me, but not in that
way. I cannot be your wife. If you
knew me as well as I know myself, you
would never ask it, for I am not fit for
it, Hugh. I am not worthy.’</p>

<p>The young man raised his head in
astonishment.</p>

<p>‘Not worthy? What do you mean?
<em>You</em>, who are as far above me as the
stars in heaven. It is <em>I</em> who have no
right to aspire to be your husband—a
rough, country clod like me, only, only—I
would love you with the best, Nell, if I
could but make you believe it.’</p>

<p>‘I <em>do</em> believe it, Hugh, and I am sorry
it should be so, because my love for you
is so different from yours. I regard you
as a dear friend. I have no other love
to give you.’</p>

<p>‘You care for some other man,’ said
Hugh, with the quick jealousy of lovers.
‘You are engaged to be married. Oh,
why did you not tell me so before? Why
have you let me go on seeing you—talking
with you and longing for you, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
giving me one hint that you had bound
yourself to marry another man? It was
cruel of you, <span class="lock">Nell—very</span>, very cruel. You
might have had more mercy on an unfortunate
fellow who has loved you all
his life.’</p>

<p>Nell shook her head.</p>

<p>‘But I’m not bound to marry another
man; I shall never marry,’ she said in
a low voice.</p>

<p>‘Then, why are you so hard on me?
Tell me the reason, Nell. There <em>must</em> be
a reason for your refusal. You owe me so
much for the pain you’ve made me suffer.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, <em>how</em> can I tell you? What good
would it do you to hear?’ she exclaimed
passionately. ‘Cannot you understand that
there may be a hundred things in a girl’s
life that make her feel indisposed to marry
the first man who asks her?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps so,’ he said mournfully; ‘I
know so little of girls or their feelings.
But I think you might give me a better
reason for your refusal, than that you are
determined not to marry.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>‘Can I trust you with the story of my
life?’ she asked. ‘Oh, yes, I’m sure I
can. You are good and faithful, and you
would never betray my confidence to
father, or mother, or Hetty, or disgrace
me in the eyes of the world.’</p>

<p>Hugh Owen grew pale at the idea, but
he answered,—</p>

<p>‘Disgrace you? How can you think
it for a moment? I would sooner disgrace
myself. But how could I do it,
Nell? What can you have ever done
to make you speak like that?’</p>

<p>‘I’ve done what the worst woman you’ve
ever met has done. Hugh, you have
forced the truth from me. Don’t blame
me if it hurts you. I am not a good girl,
like Hetty, or Sarah Kingston, or Rachel
Grove. I’m not fit to speak to any one
of them. I have no right to be at Panty-cuckoo
Farm. If father knew all, perhaps
he’d turn me out again. I—I—have <em>fallen</em>,
Hugh! and now you know the worst!’</p>

<p>The worst seemed very bad for him
to know. As the terrible confession left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
her, he turned his dark, thoughtful face aside,
and bit his lips till the blood came, but
he did not say a word. Nell had told
him the bitter truth almost defiantly, but
the utter silence by which it was succeeded
did not please her. What right
had this man, who had worried her into
saying what she never said to any other
creature, to sit there and upbraid her by
his silence? She felt as if she wanted
to shake him.</p>

<p>‘Speak, speak!’ she cried at last, impatiently.
‘Say what you like; call me all the
bad names you have ever heard applied in
such cases, but say something, for goodness’
sake. Have you never heard of such a
thing before? Have none of the girls in
Usk ever made a false step in their lives?
Don’t sit there as if the news had turned
you to stone, or you will drive me mad!’</p>

<p>Then he raised his white, strained face,
and confronted her,—</p>

<p>‘My poor, dear girl!’ he said, ‘who am
I, that I should condemn you? I am far
too conscious of my own besetting sins.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
But how did this awful misfortune happen?
Who was the man? Has he deserted you?
Won’t you tell me, Nell?’</p>

<p>‘It happened soon after I went to London,’
she answered, in a more subdued
voice. ‘I was very young at the time, you
know, Hugh, and very ignorant of the
world and the world’s ways. He—he—was
a gentleman, and I loved him, and he persuaded
me. That is the whole story, but
it has broken my heart.’</p>

<p>‘But where is this “gentleman” now?
Cannot he be induced to make you reparation?’
asked Hugh, with set teeth.</p>

<p>‘Reparation! What reparation can he
make? Do you mean marriage? What
gentleman would marry a poor girl like me—a
common farmer’s daughter? And if it
were likely, do you suppose that I would
stoop to become the wife of a man who
did not <em>want</em> to marry <span class="lock">me—who</span> did so on
compulsion? You don’t know me, Hugh.’</p>

<p>‘But, Nell, my dear Nell, do you mean
to tell me that this inhuman brute seduced
you, and then deserted you? What have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
you been doing since, Nell? Where have
you been living? I thought you came
here from service at the Earl of Ilfracombe’s?’</p>

<p>‘So I did.’</p>

<p>‘And you were with him for three years?’</p>

<p>‘I was,’ replied Nell, who felt as if her
secret were being drawn from her, bit by bit.</p>

<p>‘Then you had a shelter and a home.
Oh, Nell, do you mean to tell me that
you did this thing of your own free will,
knowing that it could not last, nor end
lawfully? When you had a refuge and an
honourable service, did you still consent to
live in concubinage with this gentleman—knowing
he only kept you as a toy which
he could get rid of whenever the whim
suited him?’</p>

<p>‘I did!’ she cried defiantly, ‘if you will
have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the <span class="lock">truth—there</span> it is. I loved
him, and I lived with him of my free consent.
It was my heaven to live with him.
I never regretted it. I only regretted when
it came to an end.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, Nell,’ he said, ‘I thought higher of
you than that.’</p>

<p>His evident misery touched her.</p>

<p>‘Hugh, how can I make you understand?’
she cried. ‘I believed it was for
ever. I knew we could never be married,
because he was so much above me; but I
thought—he told <span class="lock">me—that</span> we should never
part. I considered myself his wife, I did
indeed; and when I was undeceived it
nearly killed me.’</p>

<p>And, breaking down for the first time,
Nell burst into tears.</p>

<p>‘There, there, don’t cry,’ said Hugh,
wearily. ‘Remember, your mother might
come in at any moment, and ask the
reason of your tears. Try and restrain
yourself. Your sad secret is safe with me,
rely on that. <span class="lock">Only—only</span> let us consider, is
there really no remedy for your trouble?’</p>

<p>‘How can there be? He is married;
that is why I am here. For three years I
was the happiest woman under the sun.
He is a rich man, and he gave me more
than I ever desired; not that I cared for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
anything in comparison with his love. Ah,
if he had only left me that, I would have
begged in the streets by his side and been
happy. But it all came to an end. He
had gone away for a little while, and I had
not the least idea that he was not coming
back again. I was only longing and hoping
for his return; and then one day his lawyer
called to tell me that my <span class="lock">darling—I</span> mean
that he was going to marry some lady,
and I could be nothing ever to him again.
Hugh, it drove me mad. I didn’t know
what I was doing. I rushed out of
the house and threw myself into the
river.’</p>

<p>‘Merciful God!’ exclaimed the young
man, losing all control over himself.</p>

<p>‘I did. Father and mother think I left
service in a regular way; but they don’t
know in London where I’m gone. They
never saw me again. I daresay they think
I’m drowned. Was it very wicked, Hugh?
I did so long to die. Isn’t it funny that,
first, I should have thrown myself into the
water and been picked out again, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
had this bad illness, and still I can’t die?
Why won’t God let me end it all?’</p>

<p>‘Because He designs you for better
things, my poor Nell,’ said her companion.</p>

<p>‘I don’t think so. Better things are not
in my way. I believe I shall die a violent
death after all. I remember some time
ago—ah! it was the races <em>he</em> took me to—a
gipsy told my fortune, and she said
the same thing, that I should come to a
violent end. It little matters to me, so long
as it gives me forgetfulness and rest.</p>

<p>‘You mustn’t talk like that,’ said Hugh,
reprovingly. ‘We must all die in God’s
time, and it is our duty to wait for it. But
do you mean to say that this man has cast
you off without a thought, Nell?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no! he offered, or his lawyer did,
to settle money on me, but I would not
take it. What did I want with money
without <em>him</em>?’</p>

<p>‘You did right to refuse it. Money
coming from such a source could have
brought no blessing with it. But surely you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
do not lament the loss of this scoundrel
who, not content with betraying you, has
left you in this heartless manner for another
woman?’</p>

<p>But no true woman ever let another man
abuse her lover, however guilty he might
be, without resenting it. Least of all women
was Nell Llewellyn likely to stand such a
thing.</p>

<p>‘How <em>dare</em> you call him by such a name?’
she cried angrily. ‘Whatever he may have
done, it is not <em>your</em> place to resent it. I
am nothing to <em>you</em>. He is not a scoundrel.
There never was a more honourable, kind-hearted,
generous creature born. He would
never have deserted me if it had not been
for his lawyer, who was always dinning into
his ears that with such a property it was
his duty to marry. And the woman, too,
whom he has <span class="lock">married—she</span> inveigled him
into it. I know she did. Oh, Hugh, if I
could only kill her how happy I should be.
If I could be in the same room with her
for five minutes, with a knife in my hand,
and stab her with it to the very heart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
and see her die—die—with pain and anguish
as she has made my heart die, I think I
should be happy.’</p>

<p>‘Nell, you shock and terrify me!’ exclaimed
the young man. ‘Do you know
what you are saying? Do you know that
in harbouring such feelings you are as
guilty as if you had committed the crime
itself? What has this poor lady done to
injure you that you should cherish such
animosity against her?’</p>

<p>‘<em>What has she done?</em>’ echoed Nell
fiercely. ‘Why she has taken my lover—the
man whom I <span class="lock">adored—from</span> me.
Torn him from my very arms. She has
destroyed my <span class="lock">happiness—my</span> life. Made
the world a howling wilderness. Left my
heart bare, and striped, and empty. And
I would make her die a thousand deaths for
it if I could. I would tear her false heart from
her body and throw it to the dogs to eat.’</p>

<p>Nell’s eyes were flashing. Her head was
thrown back defiantly in the air as she
spoke; her teeth were clenched; she looked
like a beautiful, bloodthirsty tigress panting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
to fasten on her prey. But Hugh Owen
saw no beauty in her attitudes or expression.
He rose hastily from his chair, and
moved towards the door. His action arrested
her attention.</p>

<p>‘Stop!’ she cried. ‘Where are you
going? Why do you leave me alone?’</p>

<p>‘Because I cannot bear to listen to you
whilst you blaspheme like that, Nell.
Because it is too dreadful to me to hear you
railing against the wisdom of God, who has
seen fit to bring you to a sense of the life
you were leading, by wresting it from your
grasp. You have called me your friend.
So I am; but it is not the act of a friend
to encourage you in such vindictive feelings.
I could remain your friend though I knew
you guilty of every weakness common to
human nature, but I dare not take the hand
of a woman who deliberately desires the
death of a fellow-creature. Depend on it,
Nell, that this unfortunate lady, who has
married the man who behaved so basely
to you, will have enough trouble without
you wishing her more. Were it justifiable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
to harbour the thought of vengeance on any
one, yours might, with more propriety, be
directed towards him who has probably
deceived his wife as much as he deceived
you!’</p>

<p>‘If that is the spirit in which you receive
my confidence,’ said Nell hotly, ‘I wish
I had never confided in you. Perhaps the
next thing you will consider it right to
do will be to proclaim my antecedents to
the people of Usk. Make them the subject
of your next sermon maybe! I am
sure they would form a most edifying
discourse on the wickedness of the world
(and London world in particular), especially
when the victim is close at hand
to be trotted out in evidence of the truth
of what you say.’</p>

<p>Hugh raised his dark, melancholy eyes
to her reproachfully.</p>

<p>‘Have I deserved that of you, Nell?’
he asked.</p>

<p>‘I don’t care whether you have or not.
I see very plainly that I have made a
fool of myself. There was no occasion for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
me to tell you anything; but I fancied I
should have your sympathy, and blurted
it out, and my reward is to be accused
of blasphemy. It is my own fault; but
now that you have wrung my secret from
me, for pity’s sake keep it.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Nell, how can you so distrust me?
Your secret is as sacred with me as if
you were in your grave. What a brute
you must think me to imagine otherwise.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ she answered wearily.
‘I have no faith in anybody or anything
now. Why should you behave better to
me than the rest of the world has done?
No, don’t touch me,’ as he approached
her, holding out his hand. ‘Your reproaches
have turned all my milk of
human kindness into gall. Go away;
there’s a good man, and leave me to
myself. It is useless to suppose you could
understand my feelings or my heart. You
must have gone through the mill as I
have before you do.’</p>

<p>‘At least, Nell, you will let me remain
your friend,’ he said in a voice of pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>‘No, no, I want no <span class="lock">friends—nothing</span>.
Leave me with my memories. You cannot
understand them; but they are all
that remain to me now. Go on serving
God; devoting all your time and your
energies to Him, and wait till He
gives you a blow in the face, like mine,
and see what you think of His loving-kindness
then. It’ll come some day; for
Heaven doesn’t appear to spare the white
sheep any more than the black ones.
We all get it sooner or later. When
you get yours you may think you were a
little hard on me.’</p>

<p>‘I think I have got it already,’ murmured
poor Hugh, half to himself. ‘Good-bye,
Nell.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, go, do,’ she cried impetuously, ‘and
never come here again. After what you
have said to-day your presence can only
be an extra pain to me, and I have
enough of that already. Go on with your
praying and preaching, and don’t think of
me. I sha’n’t come to hear any more of
it. It does me no good, and it might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
do me harm. It might make my hand
unsteady,’ she continued, with a significant
glance, ‘when the time comes, <em>and it has
that knife in it</em>!’</p>

<p>She laughed mockingly in his face as
she delivered this parting shot, and Hugh
Owen, with a deep sob in his throat,
turned on his heel, and walked quickly
away from Panty-cuckoo Farm.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Countess of Ilfracombe had had no
desire to meet Mr Portland again; in
fact, she would have declined the honour,
had she not been afraid of exciting the
suspicions of the earl; and she had not
been under the same roof with him for
more than a few days, before she was
heartily sorry that she had not done so.
Nora was a flirt, there was no question
of that. She could keep a dozen men
at her feet at the same time, and let
each of them imagine he was the favoured
individual. But she was not a fool. She
had a countess’s coronet on her head,
and she had no intention of soiling or
risking the treasure she had won. Mr
Jack Portland was, as the reader will
have guessed, the same admirer of whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Nora had spoken to Ilfracombe before
their marriage, as having hair of the
‘goldenest golden’ hue, and who was the
only man for whose loss she had ever
shed a tear. The earl had been a little
jealous at the time, but he had forgotten
the circumstance long ago. When the
countess heard she was destined to meet
her old flame again, and as the intimate
friend of her husband, she had felt rather
afraid lest her heart should ache a little
from the encounter. But the first glance
at him had dispelled this idea. Two
years is not a long time in reality, but
it is far too long to indulge in continual
dissipation with impunity. It had wrought
havoc with the charms of Mr Jack Portland.
His manly figure had begun to
show signs of <i lang="fr">embonpoint</i>. His complexion
was very florid, and there were dropsical-looking
bags under his bloodshot eyes,
and sundry rolls of flesh rising above
the back of his collar, which are not
very attractive in the eyes of ladies. His
‘goldenest golden’ hair had commenced to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
thin on the top, and his heated breath
was too often tainted with the fumes
of alcohol. The habits he had indulged
in had destroyed the little modesty Mr
Portland had ever possessed, and he was
so presuming in his words and looks, that
Nora had been on the point, more than
once since he had come down to Thistlemere,
of telling him to hold his tongue
or leave the house. But then, there were
those unfortunate letters of hers, which
he retained, and the importance of the
contents of which, perhaps she exaggerated.
The fact is, that in the days when
Mr Portland came to Malta to stay with
the Lovelesses, he and Nora had made
very fierce love to each other. There
was no denying that, and the young
lady herself had never pretended to be
a model of all the domestic virtues.
Her father had been very angry with her,
and threatened to send her to England
to a boarding-school. But the mischief
had been done by the time Sir Richard
discovered it. People generally lock the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
door after the steed has been stolen. Not
that it had gone quite so far with Miss
Nora Abinger as that; but a great deal
of folly had passed between her and handsome
Jack Portland, a good many secret
meetings had taken place, and many letters
written. Oh, those letters, those written
protestations of eternal fidelity; those allusions
to the past; those hopes for the
future; how much mischief have they not
done in this world. We talk of women’s
tongues; they might chatter to all eternity,
and not bring one half the trouble in
their train as their too ready pens create.
Mr Portland, not being approved of by
the admiral, had found his visits to the
house not so welcome as they might
have been, and so the lovers resorted to
writing as a vent for their feelings, and
perhaps wrote more that they really felt—certainly
more than they cared to think
about or look back upon. Nora positively
shivered when she thought what
might, or might not be, in those letters
which Mr Portland had promised to deliver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
up to her as soon as he returned
to town. Meanwhile, she was on tenterhooks
and afraid to a degree of offending
the man who held such a sword of
Damocles over her head, and presumed
on his power, to treat her exactly as he
chose, with coldness or familiarity. But
if she attempted to resent his conduct,
Mr Portland could always give her a
quiet hint on the sly, that she had better
be very polite to him. So her life on
first coming to her husband’s home was
not one of roses. She could remember
the time when she had believed she loved
Jack Portland, but she wondered at herself
for having done so now. Perhaps
it was not entirely the alteration which had
taken place in himself, but more likely
that her taste had refined and become
more exclusive with the passing years.
At anyrate, his present conduct towards
her, in its quiet insolence and presumption,
made her loathe and hate him. She
wondered sometimes that her husband did
not perceive the aversion she had for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
his chosen friend, but Ilfracombe had
been very subdued and melancholy since
the day of their arrival. As Nora was
so new to English society, and could not
be presented at Court till the following
spring, they had decided to pass their
first Christmas very quietly, the Dowager
Lady Ilfracombe, and the earl’s two sisters,
Lady Laura and Lady Blanche Devenish,
being, with the exception of the obnoxious
Jack Portland, the only guests at Thistlemere.
The Ladies Devenish were not
disposed to make her life any easier than
it needed to be to the youthful countess.
In the first place, they were both considerably
older than their brother, and
resented Nora’s twenty years and her
vivacity and independence as an affront
to themselves. She ought to have been
humbler in their opinion, and more alive
to the honour that had been accorded
her. To hear her talking to the earl on
terms of the most perfect familiarity, and
just as if he had been a commoner, like
her own people, offended them. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
then they considered that Ilfracombe should
have married into the aristocracy, and
chosen a woman as high born as himself.
So they ‘held their heads high’ (as the
servants would have said) in consequence,
and elevated their eyebrows at Nora’s repartees,
when she was conversing with
gentlemen, and frowned at her boldness in
giving her opinion, especially if it happened
to clash with their own. The Dowager
Countess did not agree with her daughters.
She thought Nora a very clever, smart
and fashionable woman, and quite capable
of filling the position to which her son
had raised her, and supporting her title
with dignity.</p>

<p>‘Well, I don’t agree with you, mamma,’
said Lady Blanche. ‘I consider she is
far too forward in her manners with
gentlemen. I’m sure the way in which
Mr Portland leans over her when she
is singing is quite disgusting. I wonder
Ilfracombe does not take some notice of
it. And what could be more undignified
than her jumping up last evening to show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
Lord Babbage what she calls the “Boston
lurch?” Such a name too. I think some
of her expressions are most vulgar. I
heard her tell Ilfracombe that some place
they went to together was “confoundedly
slow.” Fancy, a lady swearing! If those
are to be the manners of the new aristocracy,
commend me to the old.’</p>

<p>‘Well, my dear,’ said her easy-going
mother, ‘you know that times are altered
from what they were. Now that so many
of our noblemen are marrying American
heiresses for money, you must expect to
see a difference. Look at the Duke of
Mussleton and Lord Tottenham! One
married a music-hall singer, and the other,
somebody a great deal worse! Young
men will have their own way in these
days. We must be thankful that Ilfracombe
has chosen a nice, lady-like, intelligent
girl for his wife. For my part, I
like Nora, and think she will make him
very happy. And,’ lowering her voice,
‘you know, my dear girls, that, considering
the dreadful life he led before, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
<em>awful</em> creature he introduced into his house,
we really should be very thankful he has
married at all. Mr Sterndale was afraid, at
one time, that nothing would break that
business off. But I feel sure Ilfracombe
has forgotten all about it. He seems quite
devoted to his wife.’</p>

<p>‘Do you really think so, mamma?’ asked
Lady Laura. ‘I think you are very short-sighted.
Blanche and I have often said
we were afraid he doesn’t care a pin for
her. Just see how melancholy and low-spirited
he seems. He goes about with a
face like a hatchet. I asked Nora yesterday
what on earth was the matter with
him—if he were <span class="lock">ill—and</span> she replied she
was sure she didn’t know. Such an indifferent
answer, it struck me, for a young
wife. But really one does not know what
to make of the girls now-a-days. They are
quite different from what they were a few
years ago. I am sure of one thing, that
Nora has no sense of the responsibility
of marrying into the aristocracy. I
heard her say once that she would just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
as soon Ilfracombe had been a tradesman!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, that must have been meant for
impertinence!’ exclaimed Lady Blanche.
‘What did she marry him for, then? I
am sure she can’t love him. She has
told me she was engaged to six men at
one time. Really, mamma, her conversation
at times is not fit for Laura and me
to listen to.’</p>

<p>‘Now you’re going a great deal too far,’
said the old countess, ‘and I won’t let
you speak of Nora in that way. Remember,
if you please, that she is the
head of the family, and that some day
you may both be dependent on her for a
chaperon.’</p>

<p>This prospect silenced the Ladies Devenish
for a time at least, and the subject
of the young Countess of Ilfracombe was
dropped by mutual consent. But their remarks
on their brother’s low spirits attracted
Nora’s attention to her husband, when she
soon perceived that they were right. Ilfracombe
was certainly depressed. He seldom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
joined in the general conversation, and when
he did his voice was low and grave. The
earl was not a brilliant talker, as has been
said before, but he had always been able
to hold his own when alone with his wife,
and used to relate every little incident
that had occurred during the day to her
as soon as they found themselves shut in
from the eyes of the world. But he had
dropped even this. Once or twice she
had rallied him on his low spirits, and had
made him still graver in consequence. But
when others began to notice his moodiness,
and make unkind remarks on it, Nora
thought it was time, for her own sake, to
try and find out the cause. It was after
a long evening spent in his company, during
which Ilfracombe had let Jack Portland
and two or three other guests do all
the talking, that his wife attacked him on
the subject. Seizing hold of his arm as
he was about to pass from her bedroom
to his dressing-room, she swung him round
and pulled him down upon the sofa by
her side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>‘Not yet, Ilfracombe,’ she said archly.
‘I want to speak to you first. You haven’t
said a word to me the whole evening.’</p>

<p>‘Haven’t I, my darling?’ he replied,
slipping his arm round her slender waist.
‘It’s only because all these confounded
women never give one time to put in a
syllable. I wish you and I were alone,
Nora. I should be so much happier.’</p>

<p>‘Should you, Ilfracombe?’ she asked, a
little fearfully. ‘Why?’</p>

<p>She was so afraid lest he should get
jealous of Mr Portland’s intimacy with her
before she had the power to promise him
she would never speak to the man again.
But Mr Portland was the last person in
Lord Ilfracombe’s mind. All he was thinking
of, was the disastrous fate of Nell
Llewellyn, and wishing he had had the
courage to tell his wife about it before
he married her.</p>

<p>‘Because, if we were alone together day
after day, we should get to know each
other’s hearts and minds better than we
do now, and I should feel more courage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
to speak to you of several little things that
annoy me.’</p>

<p>‘Things about <em>me</em>, you mean,’ she said
in her confident manner, though not without
a qualm.</p>

<p>‘Things about <em>you</em>, my angel!’ exclaimed
her enamoured husband, with genuine surprise.
‘What is there about you that could
possibly annoy me? Why, I think you
perfection—you know I <span class="lock">do—and</span> would not
have you altered in any particular for all
the world.’</p>

<p>‘Then why are you so depressed, Ilfracombe?’
said Nora. ‘It is not only I who
have noticed it. Everybody, including your
mother and sister, say the same, and it is
not very complimentary to <em>me</em>, you know,
considering we have only been married five
months, is it?’</p>

<p>Lord Ilfracombe grew scarlet. The moment
had come, he saw, for an explanation,
and how could he make it? He feared the
girl beside him would shrink from him with
horror if she heard the truth. And yet
he was a man of honour, according to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
man’s idea of honour, and could not find
it in his heart to stoop to subterfuge. If
he told Nora anything, he must tell her all.</p>

<p>‘Dearest,’ he said, laying his fair head
down on her shoulder, ‘I confess I have
felt rather miserable lately, but it has nothing
to do with you. It concerns only my
self and my past life. I have heard a very
sad story since we came home, Nora. I
wonder if I dare tell it to you?’</p>

<p>‘Why should you not, Ilfracombe? Perhaps
I can guess a good part of it before
you begin.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, no, you cannot. I would rather
not think you should. And yet you are
a little woman of the world, although you
have been so long cooped up (as you used
to tell me) in Malta. Your father told me,
when I proposed for you, that I must be
entirely frank and open with you, for that
girls now-a-days were not like the girls of
romance, but were wide awake to most
things that go on in the world, and resented
being kept in the dark where their affections
were concerned.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>‘I think my father was right,’ was all
that Nora replied.</p>

<p>‘And <span class="lock">yet—and</span> <span class="lock">yet—how</span> <em>can</em> I tell you?
What will you think of me? Nora, I have
been trying so hard to keep it to myself,
lest you should shrink from me, when you
hear the truth; and yet, we are husband
and wife, and should have no secrets from
each other. I should be wretched, I know,
if I thought <em>you</em> had ever deceived <em>me</em>.
I would rather suffer any mortification than
know that, and so perhaps you, too, would
rather I were quite honest with you, although
I have put it off so long. Would
you, my dearest?’ he asked, turning his
handsome face up to hers. Nora stooped
and kissed him. It was a genuine kiss.
She had not been accustomed to bestow
them spontaneously on her husband, but
she knew what was coming, and she felt,
for the first time, how much better Ilfracombe
was than herself.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Ilfracombe,’ she answered gravely,
‘trust me. I am, as you say, a woman of
the world, and can overlook a great deal.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>‘That kiss has emboldened me,’ said
the earl, ‘and I feel I owe it to you to
explain the reason of my melancholy.
Nora, I have been no better than other
young men—’</p>

<p>‘I never supposed you were,’ interposed
his wife.</p>

<p>‘Ah, wait till you hear all. Some years
before I met you, I took a fancy to a girl, and
she—lived in my house. You understand?’</p>

<p>Lady Ilfracombe nodded.</p>

<p>‘Most men knew of this, and your father
made it a condition of our marriage that
the whole thing was put an end to. Of
course it was what I only intended to do,
but I knew it was my duty to make some
provision for the young woman, so directed
Mr Sterndale to tell her of my intended
marriage, and settle a certain sum of money
on her. I returned to England, so happy
in you, my darling, as you well know, and
looking forward to spending such a merry
Christmas with you, for the first time in
our own home, when I was met with the
news that—that—’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>‘That—<em>what</em>, Ilfracombe? Don’t be
afraid of shocking me. Is she coming to
Thistlemere to throw some vitriol in my
face?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, my darling, don’t speak like
that. Poor Nell never would have injured
you or anyone, and it is out of her power
to do so now. She is dead, Nora—dead
by her own hand. When she heard the
news she went and threw herself into the
river. Can you wonder if I feel miserable
and self-reproachful when I remember that
I have caused that poor girl’s death? that
my great happiness has been built up on
her despair? Oh, what did the foolish child
see in me to drive her to so rash an act
for my sake? I feel as if her dead face
would haunt me to the end of my
life.’</p>

<p>And the earl covered his face with his
hands. Nora also felt very much shocked.
Death seems a terrible thing to the young
and careless. It takes sorrow and disappointment
and bodily pain to make us welcome
it as a release from all evil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, Ilfracombe,’ she whispered, ‘I am
so sorry for you. Death is an awful thing.
But I cannot see it was <em>your</em> fault. You
meant to be good and kind. She expected
too much, surely? She must have known
that some day you would marry, and it
would come to an end?’</p>

<p>‘That is just what Sterndale said!’ exclaimed
the earl joyfully; ‘and you say
the same. You do not spurn me from you,
my own darling, because of the vileness of
my former life? Oh, Nora, you are a
woman in a thousand. I have been dreading
lest you should find this disgraceful
story out, or hear it from some kind friend.
But now my mind will be at perfect rest.
You know the worst, my dearest. There
is nothing more for me to tell. We two
are one for evermore,’ and he kissed her
rapturously as he concluded.</p>

<p>Nora shuddered under her husband’s
caresses, although they had never been so
little disagreeable to her as now. How
she wished she could echo his words, and
say that she, too, had nothing more to reveal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
But those terrible letters; what did
they contain? what had she said in them,
or not said, to rise up at any moment and
spoil her life? She had never been so near
honouring Ilfracombe as at that moment—never
so near despising herself. But she
answered very quietly,—</p>

<p>‘My dear boy, you have told me nothing
new. Do you remember a letter that
you received at the hotel a few days after
we were married, Ilfracombe? You left it
in the sitting-room, and were terribly upset
because you could not find it, until the
waiter said he had destroyed one which he
picked up. He didn’t destroy your letter.
It was <em>I</em> who picked it up, and I have it
still.’</p>

<p>‘And you read it?’ said the earl, with
such genuine dismay, that it completely
restored Nora’s native assurance.</p>

<p>‘Now, what on earth do you suppose
that a woman would do with a letter of
her husband’s that she had the good fortune
to pick up?’ she cried, ‘especially a
letter from a young woman who addressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
him in the most familiar terms? Why, of
course, I read it, you simpleton, as I shall
read any others which you are careless
enough to leave on the floor. Seriously,
Ilfracombe, I have known your great secret
from the beginning; and, well, let us say
no more about it. I would rather not venture
an opinion on the subject. It’s over
and done with, and, though I’m awfully
grieved the poor woman came to so tragic
an end, you cannot expect me, as your wife,
to say that I’m sorry she’s out of the way.
I think it is awfully good of you to have
told me of it, Ilfracombe. Your confidence
makes me feel small, because I know I
haven’t told you everything that <em>I’ve</em> ever
done; but then, you see,’ added Nora, with
one of her most winning expressions of
naughtiness, ‘I’ve done such lots, I can’t
remember the half of it. It will come to
the surface by degrees, I daresay; and if
we live to celebrate our golden wedding,
you may have heard all.’</p>

<p>But Ilfracombe would not let her finish
her sentence. He threw his arms around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
her, and embraced her passionately, saying,—</p>

<p>‘You’re the best and dearest and sweetest
wife a man ever had, and I don’t care
what you’ve done, and I don’t want to hear
a word about it; only love me a little in
return for my great love for you.’</p>

<p>But Lady Ilfracombe knew the sex too
well not to be aware that, if he had imagined
there was anything to tell, he would
not have rested till he had heard it; and,
as she lay down to sleep that night, all her
former love of intrigue and artifice seemed
to have deserted her, and she wished from
the bottom of her heart that she could
imitate the moral courage of her husband,
and “leave the future nothing to
reveal.”’</p>

<h2 class="no-break ls" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Dowager Countess of Ilfracombe was
an amiable old lady, but she was also
very fond and proud of her son, and
anxious to preserve his interests. His
long friendship with Miss Llewellyn had
been a great sorrow to her, and she was
rejoiced when she heard that he had
made a respectable marriage. But the
remarks of her daughter on Nora’s behaviour
had made her a little more observant,
and for the next few days she
watched the young countess narrowly.
The consequence of which was that she
determined to have a private talk with the
girl, and the first time she found her
alone she proceeded to the attack.</p>

<p>She was a sweet old lady this dowager
countess, like her son in many ways,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
with soft grey curls each side her face,
and mild blue eyes and delicately-chiselled
features. She drew her chair close to that
on which her daughter-in-law sat, carelessly
turning over the latest magazines,
and laid her withered hand on the girl’s
slim, white one,—</p>

<p>‘Reading, my dear,’ she commenced
pleasantly. ‘Is there anything particularly
good in the Christmas numbers this year?’</p>

<p>‘Not much,’ replied Nora, laying the
magazine down. ‘The stories are all on
the same old lines. I wish they would
invent something new. I think it is so
silly to imagine that Christmas tales must
all take place in the snow, or be mixed
up with a ghost. Isn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘Very silly,’ acquiesced the old lady,
‘but as long as there are fools found to
read them there will be fools left to write
them. But where is Ilfracombe this afternoon?
Has he left you all alone to the
mercy of the Christmas numbers?’</p>

<p>Nora laughed.</p>

<p>‘It is my own fault,’ she said. ‘He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
wanted me to go out driving with him;
but I thought it was too cold. So I
think he and Mr Portland have walked
over to Critington to play billiards with
Lord Babbage.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, I thought dear Ilfracombe had not
forgotten his little wife,’ said the dowager
in a patronising tone of voice, which
Nora immediately resented. ‘He is too
good and amiable for that. I am sure
that you find him most kind in everything.
Don’t you, dear?’</p>

<p>The young countess shrugged her
shoulders.</p>

<p>‘So, so; much the same as other
young men,’ she answered, and then perceiving
the look of astonishment on her
mother-in-law’s face, she added, apologetically,—‘You
see, Lady Ilfracombe, that I’m
not a gusher, and I’ve known so many
men I’ve learned to pretty well estimate
the value of them.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps, my dear, though I cannot say
I think the knowledge an enviable one
for a young lady. But you do not rank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
your husband with other men, surely?
He loves you <span class="lock">dearly—anyone</span> could see
that—and you must have a good deal of
influence over him.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I fancy I’ve got the length of
his foot,’ replied Nora.</p>

<p>‘My dear son is almost all that a son
and a husband should be,’ continued the
fond mother. ‘He has no vices, but he
has some weaknesses, and one is, being
too easily influenced by his friends, and
all his friends are not such as I should
choose for him. I may be wrong, but I
distrust that Mr Portland with whom
Ilfracombe is so intimate. More than
that, I dislike him.’</p>

<p>‘So do I,’ said Nora shortly.</p>

<p>A look of satisfaction came into her
companion’s face.</p>

<p>‘Do you really, Nora? I am so glad
to hear you say so, for I fancied that he
was a great friend of yours.’</p>

<p>‘What, Mr Portland? Oh, Lady Ilfracombe,
how mistaken you are. If I had
my will I would never ask him to Thistlemere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
again. But you won’t tell <em>him</em> so,
will you?’ she said, looking fearfully
round.</p>

<p>‘My dear girl, what are you thinking
of? As if it were likely. But, Nora, now
you have told me so, I must tell you
what is in my mind. Mr Portland has,
in my opinion, been Ilfracombe’s worst
enemy for years. Not wilfully so, of
course; but he is a man who almost <em>lives</em>
upon the turf, and is always betting and
gambling. He has no settled income, or
a very small one. He is, in fact, an
adventurer, though our dear Ilfracombe
would be angry if he heard me say so.
I am sure this Mr Portland borrows
large sums of him. My brother, General
Brewster, warned me of it long ago. He
has also encouraged Ilfracombe in many
things which I cannot speak to you about,
but which a word from Mr Portland
would have made him see the folly of.
But he has been his evil genius. You
must be his good genius, and rid Ilfracombe
of him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>The old lady smiled very kindly at
Nora as she said this. She was so relieved
to find that she did not stick up
for the <i lang="fr">vaurien</i> Jack Portland as she had
feared she might do.</p>

<p>‘I? Lady Ilfracombe!’ exclaimed the
young countess, with somewhat of a scared
look; ‘but what could I do? Mr Portland
is my husband’s friend, not mine.
I don’t think Ilfracombe would hear a
word against him.’</p>

<p>‘I think he would be the first to listen
and approve, my dear, were you to complain
to him of the offensive familiarity
with which Mr Portland treats you. I
don’t think it is either respectful to your
rank or yourself. Several people have
noticed it. To see that dissipated-looking
man hanging over you, as he often does,
at the piano or the sofa, with his red
face close to yours, sometimes almost
whispering in your ear before other
people, is most indecent. Ilfracombe should
put a stop to it, and the proper person
to draw his attention to it is yourself.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>‘I hate it! I detest it!’ cried Nora,
her face flushing with annoyance and the
knowledge that she had put it out of her
power to resent such conduct, as she
ought to do. ‘I think Mr Portland is
vulgar and presuming to a degree; but if
it is Ilfracombe’s pleasure to have him
here he would surely not like me the
better for making mischief between them.’</p>

<p>‘I should not call it “making mischief,”’
replied the dowager. ‘I should
say it was what was due to your position
as Ilfracombe’s wife. However, my dear,
perhaps you know best. Only, pray
promise me to discourage that odious
man as much as possible. I shall have
to speak to him some day myself, if you
don’t.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, indeed, I will, Lady Ilfracombe.
I will come and sit close by you every
day after dinner if you will let me, and
then he will hardly have the presumption
I should think, to thrust himself between
us.’</p>

<p>‘My dear, I should not like to put a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
limit to Mr Portland’s presumption. He
is one of the most offensive men I have
ever met. However, if you dislike him
as much as I do, there is no harm done,
and I should think, judging from your
courageous and independent manner, that
you are quite capable of keeping him at
a distance, if you choose.’</p>

<p>‘I hope so,’ laughed Nora uneasily.
‘Don’t have any fears for me, dear
Lady Ilfracombe. My only wish in this
particular is not to annoy my husband
by offending his great friend, whom he
has commended over and over again to
my hospitality; but, if matters go too far,
he shall hear of it, I promise you.’</p>

<p>The dowager kissed her daughter-in-law,
and felt perfectly satisfied with the
way in which she had received her advice,
telling the Ladies Devenish afterwards
that they had taken an utterly
wrong view of the young countess’s conduct,
and she only wished every young
married woman were as well able to
take care of herself and her husband’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
honour. The Ladies Devenish shrugged
their ancient shoulders as soon as her
back was turned, and told each other
that ‘mother’s geese were always swans,
and, of course, anyone whom Ilfracombe
had married, could do no wrong in her
eyes.’ But they ceased making remarks
on Nora for the future all the same.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the young countess did all
she could, without being positively rude,
to discourage Jack Portland’s intimacy
with her. She kept as close as she
could to her mother and sisters-in-law,
and took every precaution to prevent herself
being left alone with him; but perceived,
in a few days, that Mr Portland
had guessed the cause of her avoidance,
and was prepared to resent it. If he
could not get an opportunity of speaking
to her privately during the evening, he
would stand on the hearthrug and gaze
at her with his bloodshot eyes, till she
was afraid that everybody in the room
must guess the secret between them.
One afternoon, as they were seated round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
the luncheon-table, he lolled over her
and stared so fixedly into her face, that
she felt as if she must rebuke his conduct
openly. She saw the dowager put
up her eyeglass to observe them, and
the Ladies Devenish nudge each other
to look her way; Ilfracombe, of all present,
seemed to take no notice of Mr
Portland’s behaviour. Nora writhed like a
bird in the coils of a serpent. She did
not know how to act. She could have
slapped the insolent, heated face which
was almost thrust in her own; she professed
not to hear the words addressed
to her in a lowered tone, but tried to
treat them playfully, and told him to
‘speak up.’ But it was useless. She
saw Jack Portland’s bloated face grow
darker and darker as she parried his
attempts at familiarity, until she dreaded
lest, in his anger at her repulsion, he
should say something aloud that would
lower her for ever in the eyes of her
relations. Who can trust the tongue of
a man who is a habitual drinker? At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
last Nora could stand it no longer, and,
rising hastily, she asked the dowager to
excuse her leaving the table, as she did
not feel well. Her plea was sufficient
to make her husband follow her, but he
could not get the truth out of her, even
when alone.</p>

<p>‘It’s nothing,’ she told him when he
pressed her to say if she were really
ill; ‘but the room was warm, and I
didn’t want any more luncheon, and Mr
Portland bored me.’</p>

<p>‘<em>Jack bored you!</em>’ exclaimed the earl
in a voice of astonishment, as if such a
thing could never be, ‘I never heard a
woman say that before. Shall I speak
to him about it, darling?’</p>

<p>But Nora’s look of horror at the proposal
was enough to answer the question.</p>

<p>‘Speak to him, Ilfracombe? Oh, no,
pray don’t. What <em>would</em> he think of
me? It would sound so horribly rude,
and when he is a guest in the house too.
Never mention it again, please. I wouldn’t
offend a friend of yours for the world.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>‘Thanks. Yes, I’m afraid dear old
Jack might feel a little sore if I were
to tell him he bored you. But it
mustn’t be allowed to occur again, Nora.
I’ll take him out of the house more
than I have done. He won’t worry
you this afternoon, for we’re going to
ride over to the Castle together and pay
old Nettleton a visit. I want to get a
brace of his pointers if he will part
with them. We mean to be home to
dinner; but if we’re a little late, don’t
wait for us.’</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ said Nora brightly.</p>

<p>She was glad to think she would be
relieved from her <i lang="fr">bête noir</i> for the afternoon
at all events.</p>

<p>The earl stooped and kissed her, and
ran downstairs. Nora would have liked
to return that kiss, but as she was about
to do it, she suddenly felt shy and drew
back again. Women are so generally
accredited with changing their minds,
that when they do so, they don’t like
to confess the truth. But she waved her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
hand gaily as Lord Ilfracombe left the
room, and sent him off on his expedition
happy and contented. The afternoon
passed quietly away; nothing unusual
occurred until the ladies had assembled
in the drawing-room, preparatory to dinner
being served.</p>

<p>‘Ilfracombe particularly requested that
we should not wait if he were late,’ said
Nora to her mother-in-law; ‘so I think
we had better not do so. I fancy he
had some idea that Mr Nettleton might
press them to dine at the Castle—any
way that was what he said to me.’</p>

<p>‘I would give them ten minutes’ grace,
my dear,’ replied the dowager; ‘the roads
are very bad to-day, and they may not
reach home as soon as they anticipated.
It is so uncomfortable to come in just
as the soup has been removed. Besides,
they must change their clothes before
dining.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, you are right,’ replied Nora,
glancing at the clock on the mantelpiece,
‘it is a quarter to seven now. I will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
ring and tell Warrender to put off dinner
till half-past. Shall I?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, my dear, do,’ the old lady was
saying, just as Warrender entered the
room unceremoniously, and with an air of
decided perturbation.</p>

<p>‘What is the matter?’ cried Nora
hurriedly, for she saw at once he was
the bearer of news. ‘What has occurred?
Why do you look like that?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, my lady!’ exclaimed the servant,
‘nothing, I <span class="lock">hope—your</span> ladyship mustn’t
be alarmed, but I thought it right you
should hear that—that—’</p>

<p>‘That—<em>what</em>? For God’s sake, speak!’
cried Nora impetuously. ‘It is folly to
keep us in such suspense.’</p>

<p>‘Well, my lady, Johnson, he has just
come up from the stables to say that
the Black <span class="lock">Prince—his</span> lordship’s horse,
you know, my <span class="lock">lady—ran</span> into the yard a
few minutes back, <span class="lock">without—without</span> his
lordship, my lady!’</p>

<p>‘Thrown!’ exclaimed Lady Laura shrilly.</p>

<p>‘Without Lord Ilfracombe?’ queried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
Lady Blanche; ‘but where, then, is Mr
Portland?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, heavens, my poor son! He may
be lying dead in the road at this moment,’
said the dowager, wringing her hands.</p>

<p>But Nora said nothing. She was
standing in the centre of the room,
motionless as though turned to stone.
Presently she asked in a harsh voice,—</p>

<p>‘Have they sent out to search along
the roads?’</p>

<p>‘No, my lady, they thought—’ commenced
Warrender.</p>

<p>‘Thought? Thought? What is the good
of thinking when they should act? Tell
Johnson to go out at once and scour
the road to the Castle, and let the
carriage be got ready to follow him.
His lordship may be unable to walk. Go
at once; don’t lose a moment. Stay,
where is Johnson? I will give him the
directions myself.’</p>

<p>She flew down to the lower premises
as she spoke, regardless that her dress
was quite unsuited to cold corridors and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
stone passages. She was very white,
but perfectly calm and collected as she
gave her orders, whilst Lady Laura was
shrieking in hysterics in the drawing-room,
and Lady Blanche had her hands
full in trying to prevent the dowager
fainting under the dreadful suspense. As
soon as Nora was satisfied that assistance
had been dispatched in case of need,
she went slowly up to her own room,
with her hand tightly pressed against her
heart. She could not realise what might
be taking place, or might have taken
place. She had only one fear, one
dread, Ilfracombe and she might be
parted before she had had time to tell him
that she loved him. She kept both hands
and teeth clenched to prevent her crying
out, and making her cowardice patent
to all around, whilst her cold lips went
on murmuring, ‘Oh, God, save him! oh,
God, save him!’ without any idea of
the meaning of what she said.</p>

<p>She had stood thus, not having the
heart or the sense to sit down, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
perhaps half an hour, when she heard a
shout from the <span class="lock">hall—a</span> shout of laughter,
and then her husband’s voice exclaiming,—</p>

<p>‘So sorry to have given you such a
scare. Not my fault I assure you. We
came on as quick as we could. No,
I’m not hurt. Was Nora frightened?
Where is she? I must go to her. Down
in a minute. Tell you all about it then,’
and his feet came flying two steps at a
time up the stairs to her side.</p>

<p>She stood with clasped hands expecting
him, all the blood in her body
mantling in her face.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Ilfracombe,’ was all she could
say as he entered the room.</p>

<p>‘My darling, I am so sorry that brute
frightened you all so by coming home
without me. Jack and I were within a
mile of home when the Black Prince
shied suddenly at something and threw
me clean over his head. We tried our
best to catch him, but he bolted to his
stables, and I had to walk back.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>‘And you are not hurt?’ she asked
tremblingly; ‘not at all?’</p>

<p>‘Not at all,’ he echoed, ‘only splashed
from head to foot with mud, and feeling
very much as if I would like to have
a warm bath before dinner. But, love,
you are shaking all over. Has it really
upset you like this?’</p>

<p>Nora drew back a little, ashamed of
having displayed so much feeling.</p>

<p>‘It was rather alarming,’ she answered,
with a slight laugh. ‘We—we—might—never
have seen you again.’</p>

<p>‘And you would have grieved for me?’
said the earl, pressing her to his heart.
‘Oh, my dearest, you make me feel so
happy.’</p>

<p>A sudden impulse, which she could not
resist, seized Nora. She threw her slender
arms round Ilfracombe and laid her cheek
against his. It was the first evidence of
deep feeling which she had ever given
him. But a moment afterwards she seemed
ashamed of it.</p>

<p>‘There is no doubt you gave us a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
start, dear old boy,’ she said, smiling,
‘but it is over now, and I’ll run down
and send Wilkins up to get your bath
ready. You’ll have heaps of time. I
had already postponed dinner to half-past
seven. Make as much haste as you
can though.’</p>

<p>‘One more kiss, darling, before you go,’
cried the earl.</p>

<p>‘No such thing! We mustn’t waste
any more time in fooling or the fish will
be in rags. I will go down and see that
Lady Ilfracombe has a glass of wine.
The poor old lady has been crying fit
to make herself ill.’ And in another
second she had left him to himself.</p>

<p>She found the drawing-room people in
solemn conclave; the Ladies Devenish
rather inclined to be offended at being
disappointed of a sensation, and the
dowager, telling Mr Portland of the
terrible scare they had experienced, and
how she thought poor dear Nora would
go mad when the news of the riderless
horse’s arrival was announced to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>‘I am sure I thought her mind was
going, Mr Portland,’ she was saying as
Nora entered. ‘She stood as if she had
been turned to marble, and when she
rushed from the room I thought she
was going to fly out into the night
air just as she was after him.’</p>

<p>‘Of course it would have been an
awful thing for Lady Ilfracombe to have
lost her position so soon after attaining
it,’ replied Mr Portland politely.</p>

<p>‘And her husband,’ returned the old
lady sympathetically.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that Nora
appeared. She was still pale from the
fright she had experienced, and had lost
much of her usual jolly, off-hand manner.</p>

<p>‘Ilfracombe will be down directly,’ she
said, addressing her mother-in-law; ‘he
is going to have a bath before dinner,
as, though he has broken no bones, he
has a considerable number of bruises from
the fall.’</p>

<p>‘Of course, poor, dear boy,’ acquiesced
the dowager. ‘Oh, my dear, what a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
mercy it is no worse. He might have
been killed from such a sudden fall. I
shall never feel easy when he is on
horseback again.’</p>

<p>‘Never is a long time,’ replied Nora,
smiling; ‘but won’t you and Blanche and
Laura take a glass of wine before dinner?
I am sure you must need it after the
shock you have had.’</p>

<p>The wine was rung for, and when
Warrender appeared with it, and Nora
refused to have any, Mr Portland took
the opportunity of observing sarcastically,—</p>

<p>‘Surely <em>you</em> must require some yourself,
Lady Ilfracombe? I have just been
listening to an account of the terrible
emotion you displayed at the supposition
of Ilfracombe’s danger.’</p>

<p>The butler poured out a glass and
handed it to his young mistress without
a word. He had seen her excitement
and interpreted it aright, but he did
not understand why this gentleman should
mention it as though it were something
to be surprised at.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>The young countess took the wine
silently and drank it. Portland again
addressed her.</p>

<p>‘It must have been an awful moment
for you when Black Prince’s arrival was
announced. Did you really think Ilfracombe
was killed? It would have been
a great misfortune for you if it had been
so. The title would have gone, I believe,
to a distant cousin, and the whole object
of his marriage frustrated. And you
would have sunk at once from the queen
regnant to a mere dowager. Aren’t you
glad he is all right?’</p>

<p>This was said <i lang="la">sotto voce</i>, so as to
be inaudible to the rest of the party.</p>

<p>‘I do not see that it signifies to you,
what I feel, or do not feel,’ said Nora,
with her most indifferent air, as she turned
from Jack Portand to address some commonplace
to her mother-in-law.</p>

<p>‘By Jove, though, but I’ll make it
signify!’ he muttered to himself, as he
saw the Ladies Devenish secretly amused
at the evident snub he had received.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
The earl now joined the assembly. He
was in high spirits, and disposed to make
light of everything that had occurred.
The evening passed pleasantly, though
Nora was rather hysterically gay; but
towards the close of it, when the other
ladies had retired, and she was about to
follow their example, her husband was told
that his steward wished to speak to him.</p>

<p>‘Don’t go yet, Nora,’ he called out,
on leaving the room, ‘wait till I come
back. I want to tell you something before
Jack and I go to the smoking-room.
Keep her amused, Jack, till I return.’</p>

<p>It was Jack Portland’s opportunity, and
he seized it.</p>

<p>‘What an actress you are,’ he commenced,
as soon as they were alone.
‘You would have made your fortune on
the stage.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t understand you,’ she said. ‘In
what have I acted a part to-night?’</p>

<p>‘Why, in your well counterfeited dismay
at the idea of danger to Ilfracombe,
of course. When the old lady was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
telling me about it, I thought I should
have split. <em>You</em>—turned to stone with
apprehension. <em>You</em>—the coldest woman
in Christendom! who has no more feeling
than a piece of marble! It is
ridiculous. You know it was all put
on.’</p>

<p>‘Why shouldn’t I feel uneasy if he is
in danger? He is my husband. You
cannot deny that.’</p>

<p>‘Your husband, yes. And what did
you marry him for? His title and his
money! You cannot deny that. Two
years ago you were, or fancied yourself,
desperately in love with another man—modesty
forbids me to mention him by
name—but you chucked him over; why?
Because he hadn’t as much money as you
expected to sell yourself for!’</p>

<p>‘It isn’t true,’ she answered hotly. ‘You
know that it was my father who separated
us and forbade your coming to the house
again. Else, perhaps, there is no knowing
I might have been your wife at the
present moment. But as for being, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
you express it, “desperately in love,” you
know that is <span class="lock">untrue—that</span> it is not in my
nature—that I am not one of your
gushing, spooney girls, who are ready to
jump down the throat of the first man
who looks at them, and never was.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I wouldn’t be too sure of that,’
said Mr Portland. ‘Certain little epistles
in my possession tell a different tale. Most
of them are “spooney” enough in all
conscience. At least, if you do not call
them so, I should like to see the ones
you do!’</p>

<p>‘You have not returned those letters
to me yet,’ she answered quickly. ‘I
trust to your honour to do so, without
reading them again.’</p>

<p>‘Why should I read them again, <i lang="fr">ma
chère</i>, when they no longer interest me?
I know you women like to think you can
chuck your victims over, and still keep
them writhing at your feet; but I am
not one of that sort. Once repulsed is
enough for me. Your ladyship need never
fear that I shall ever trouble you again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
But don’t say you never were one of the
“gushing, spooney girls,” or you may
tempt me to make you retract your
words. Perhaps you have quite forgotten
what you wrote in those letters?’ he
demanded meaningly.</p>

<p>‘Yes, quite,’ she answered, though with
a sickening faint remembrance of a great
deal of folly; ‘but what does it matter?
It is over now on both sides, and we can
remain good friends all the same. But
I wish you would not make your intimacy
with me quite so apparent before other
people. It has been noticed by more
than one person, and it places me in an
unpleasant position. And if it is pointed
out to Ilfracombe it might lead to something
disagreeable.’</p>

<p>‘How?’ said her companion.</p>

<p>‘How? Why, by making a quarrel
between my husband and myself, of
course,’ replied Nora querulously.</p>

<p>‘And would you care about that? He
couldn’t take your coronet from you for
such a trifle, you know. Even those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
letters of <span class="lock">yours—were</span> they to come to
light, he might rub rusty over them, but
he couldn’t do anything. When a man
marries a woman, he has to ignore all
ante-nuptial indiscretions. He would make
a jolly row, naturally, and you would have
a hot time of it. But you are the Countess
of Ilfracombe fast enough, and the
Lord Chancellor himself couldn’t unmake
you so.’</p>

<p>‘I know that,’ said Nora. ‘I don’t
need you to tell me so. And there is
no chance of Ilfracombe seeing the letters
either. If you keep your word to me
(as I conclude you will), I shall destroy
them as soon as they are in my possession.
I wish you would send for your
dispatch-box, and give them to me at
once. I should feel so much more comfortable.’</p>

<p>‘Why in such a hurry?’ said Mr
Portland. ‘I am going home next week,
and then you shall have them by registered
post, honour bright. Won’t that satisfy
you?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, yes, of course. And Mr Portland,’
added Nora rather nervously, ‘we agreed
just now that it was all over, so you won’t
mind my saying you think I care only for
Ilfracombe’s title and fortune, and I daresay
you are justified in thinking so—but—but
it is not only that. <span class="lock">He—he</span> is so
good to me, that I can’t help caring—I
mean, it would be very ungrateful of me
not to care, just a little.’</p>

<p>But here the young countess’s blushing,
stammering confession was interrupted by
her husband’s return.</p>

<p>‘Oh, here <em>is</em> Ilfracombe!’ she exclaimed,
suddenly breaking off, and advancing to
meet him, whilst Jack Portland thought to
himself; ‘so the wind’s in that quarter
now, is it? All the better for me; but
I’m afraid her ladyship has sealed the fate
of that interesting little packet. If love
is to be brought into the bargain, those
letters will become too valuable to me
to part with. Why, I shall be able
to turn and twist her, through their
means, at my will.’</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> time was altered at Panty-cuckoo
Farm. Christmas had come and gone—rather
a melancholy Christmas. The
weather had been raw and chill; Mrs
Llewellyn had been laid up with sciatica;
and the farmer had appeared depressed
and out of spirits. Hugh Owen had left
off coming to the farm altogether, at
which Nell was not surprised, though
her mother grumbled, and her father
said that with some people out of sight
seemed out of mind. But with the advent
of spring things grew better. Is it not
always the way with spring? Its bright,
hopeful surroundings seemed to make one
ashamed of murmuring over one’s own
troubles. The bursting buds; the rivulets
released from the icy grip of winter;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
the callow birds; the balmy life-giving
air; all speak of renewed action and
strength, after the numbing effects of
winter. One grows young again with
spring. The buoyancy of the atmosphere,
and all the glad sights and sounds that
salute one’s eyes and ears, seem to fill one
with new <span class="lock">feelings—new</span> <span class="lock">ideas—new</span> hopes.
Even Nell succumbed to the delights
of the season, and felt sorry to think
she had driven her kindest friend from
her side. She had tried several times
to see Hugh Owen, and make up her
quarrel with him, but he always managed
to avoid meeting her. There was a baby
at Dale Farm now, over which Hetty
and her mother-in-law were crooning half
the day, with which, of course, old Mrs
Llewellyn was delighted, but which Nell
never saw without a sigh. She thought
that when Hugh christened her little
nephew, she would at least secure a
word or two with him in private, but
it was not so. He never turned his
eyes her way during the ceremony, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
pleaded other duties as an excuse for
not being present at the substantial feast
which was spread for them afterwards at
Dale Farm.</p>

<p>‘I can’t think what’s come of Hugh
lately,’ said his mother. ‘He was never
what you might call very sociable-like,
but now it’s a wonder ever to get a
word out of him. He seems to spend
his life praying people out of the world,
and I’m sure it don’t make him more
cheerful at home.’</p>

<p>‘There, missus, let the lad alone, do!’
exclaimed her husband. ‘You know’d from
the first that he was good for nothing
but the ministry. He’s got no heart,
nor stomach, nor liver, nor nothing, hasn’t
Hugh; he’s just a minister and nothing
else. He’s been as silent and as sulky
as a bear for the last three months, but
I take no notice of it. Let him go on
his own way, say I, and thank the Lord,
’tain’t mine.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I suppose we’ve offended him,
though I’m sure I can’t tell how,’ interposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
Mrs Llewellyn, ‘for he’s not been
near us for ever so long. When our
Nell was ill, he was at the farm every
day, praying most beautiful, and bringing
her books and flowers, and such-like;
but I don’t believe we’ve seen him, not
to speak of, since Christmas, have we,
Nell?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t think we have, mother,’ replied
Nell consciously.</p>

<p>‘Oh, that’s plain enough,’ said Farmer
Owen. ‘You ain’t dying any longer, my
lass, or you’d have Master Hugh at your
bedside often enough. He don’t care for
lasses with rosy cheeks, and who can
eat a good dinner, and use their legs.
They’ve no interest for a minister. You
shouldn’t have got well, if you wanted to
keep Hugh by your side.’</p>

<p>‘Well, for my part, I wish she was
better than she is, if we never saw Hugh
again for it, begging your pardons, neighbours.
But Nell ain’t half satisfactory.
Dr Cowell, he says it’s only the weakness
after the fever, but she’s a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
time coming round, to my mind. She
eats pretty well, but she hasn’t got any
life in her, nor she can’t seem to take
any interest in anything. Her memory
too is something dreadful. She’s always
dreaming when she ought to be doing.
We must see if we can’t send her to
Swansea this summer for the benefit of
the sea air.’</p>

<p>Nell coloured faintly as she replied,—</p>

<p>‘Now, mother, I wish you’d talk of
something more interesting than me. I’m
right enough. And we’re all talking of
ourselves, and forgetting the little man’s
health. Who’ll propose the toast? Shall
I? Here’s to the very good health of
Griffith William Owen, and may he live
a long life and a happy one!’</p>

<p>And in the chatter and congratulations
that followed the toast, Nell and Hugh
were both happily forgotten. All the
same, she wished he had not taken her
communication so much to heart, and was
dreadfully afraid lest his evident avoidance
of Panty-cuckoo Farm should end by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
directing some sort of suspicion towards
herself. It was about this time that Nell
perceived that there was something decidedly
wrong with her father. Not in
health, but in mind. He seemed to regard
everything in its worst light, and to have
some objection to make to whatever might
be said to him. If her mother remarked
how comfortable and happy Hetty was in
her new home, Mr Llewellyn would
observe,—</p>

<p>‘Ay, ay, it’s just as well she’s feathered
her nest before troubles come,’ or if Nell
said she felt stronger and better for the
fine weather, it would be, ‘Well, I don’t
know as it’s a thing to crow over. Many
a person’s happier dead than alive.’</p>

<p>At last one morning she came down to
breakfast to find him in a brown study
over a lawyer’s letter, which had reached
him in a long, blue envelope. The postman
was a rare visitor at Panty-cuckoo
Farm. The Llewellyns had not many
relatives, and were not a writing family,
if they had had them. Everything went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
on too simply with them to require much
correspondence. Above all, a lawyer’s letter
was a rarity.</p>

<p>‘Had bad news, father?’ inquired Nell,
as she met him.</p>

<p>‘Ay, my lass, as bad as it could well
be. Sir Archibald Bowmant’s going to
raise the rent of the old farm again, and
I don’t know how it’s to be made to
pay it. Times have been awful bad the
last year or two, Nell. Of course, the
mother didn’t say nothing to you up in
London town about it. Where was the
use? You was well provided for in a
rare good and respectable situation; we
knew you was safe, and didn’t want
to worry you with our troubles. But
since Sir Archibald’s married this new
lady he’s been an altered man. He used
to think a deal of his tenants in the old
times, and I don’t say he’s a bad landlord
now, but she runs him into a lot
of money, I hear, and then the land has
to pay for it. Here’s a notice from the
solicitor, to say the rents will all be raised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
again after next summer. It’s deuced hard
on a man like me. I’ve spent more than
I knew where to put my hand on, this
autumn, draining and manuring, and now
I shall have to pay all I hoped to make
by it on the rent. But it can’t go
on for ever. The worm will turn some
day, and I shall chuck up the farm and
emigrate.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, father, don’t talk like that!’
cried his wife. ‘What would you and
I do emigrating at our age? ’Tisn’t
as if we were young and strong. We
should die before we had crossed the
sea. We’ll get on right enough, now
I’ve got Nell to help me with the dairy,
and that must keep us going till you’re
straight again.’</p>

<p>‘You’re a good wife, Mary,’ said the
farmer, ‘but you’re a fool for all that.
Will the dairy keep the men and horses,
and pay for the subsoil dressings and
the fish-manure and the losses which
every year brings with it? You women
don’t understand the number of expenses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
keeping up a large farm like this entails.
I’ve only just done it for years past, and
if the rents are to be raised, why, I <em>can’t</em>
do it, and that’s all.’</p>

<p>‘But you won’t decide in a hurry,
father?’ said Nell.</p>

<p>‘No, lass, no. But it’s very discouraging.
It takes the heart out of
a man for work, or anything. Sometimes
I wish I had emigrated when I
was a young man. There, out in Canada,
the Government give a man one hundred
and fifty acres of land free, and, if he’s
got a little money of his own and a
little gumption, he can make a living for
his family, and have something to leave
behind him when he dies.’</p>

<p>‘Well, well,’ said his daughter soothingly,
‘if the worst comes to the worst,
father, I will go out to Canada with
mother and you, and we’ll see if we
can’t manage to keep ourselves alive
somehow.’</p>

<p>She put her hand on the old man’s
grey head as she spoke, and he got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
hold of it and drew it down with his
own.</p>

<p>‘What a soft, white hand it is!’ he
said admiringly. ‘You’re a good, kind
lass, Nell, but I doubt if you could do
much work with such fingers as these.
Where did you get them from? Who’d
think you’d done hard work in your
lifetime? They look like a lady’s, so
smooth and soft. You must have had a
fine easy place of it up at Lord Ilfracombe’s,
Nell. It was a pity you ever left
it. You won’t get such another in a hurry.’</p>

<p>‘No, father, I know that,’ she answered
sadly.</p>

<p>‘And you think you were foolish to
chuck it, my girl? You fret a bit over it
sometimes, eh, Nell?’</p>

<p>‘Sometimes, father,’ she said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>‘Ah, my lass, you see we never know
what’s best for us. I was main glad to
see ye home, so was mother; but if times
get worse than they are, I shall be sorry
ye ever came.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>‘Then I’ll go to service again,’ she
answered quickly. ‘Don’t be afraid I’ll
ever be a burden on you, dear father. I
am capable of filling many situations—a
nurse’s, for instance. If, as you say,
times get worse, I’ll practise on little
Griffith, and advertise for a place in the
nursery.’</p>

<p>She spoke in jest, but Mr Llewellyn
took her words in earnest.</p>

<p>‘Ay, my lass, and you’d get it too.
The earl would give you a grand
character, I’m bound to say. Wouldn’t
he, now? Three years is a good time
to stay in one place.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, of course,’ said Nell hastily,
as she remembered the circumstances
under which she had left Grosvenor
Square, and hurried away for fear her
father should take it in his head to question
her about it.</p>

<p>Poor Nell! Her absent lord was
never absent from her heart or thoughts;
but she dared not indulge herself in
too much reminiscence lest she should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
break down under it. Whilst Lord Ilfracombe
was growing happier day by day
in the increasing affection of his wife,
the unfortunate woman whom he believed
to be buried beneath the bosom
of the river was wearing her heart out
for news of him, and wondering often
how she could possibly contrive to get
sight or speech with him without attracting
the attention of her friends. By
day she had little leisure to indulge in
dreaming; but as soon as night fell,
and she found herself in solitude and
silence on her bed, the ghost of her
happy, reckless past would walk out of
its sanctuary to confront her, and she
would lie awake half the night, pondering
on Ilfracombe’s appearance, and
recalling his tenderest moments and sayings
and doings, till she had worked
herself up into a state of despair. She
had persuaded herself that her separation
from her lover was no fault of his,
but the combined work of Mr Sterndale
and the woman he had married, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
that if Ilfracombe saw her again all
his first admiration and affection would
be rekindled.</p>

<p>Nell did not stop to consider how
bitterly unfair this would be to his young
wife. She hated the very thought of
Nora, and would have injured her in
any possible way. Lord Ilfracombe was
hers—hers <span class="lock">alone—that</span> was the way she
argued—and his wife had robbed her of
him, and must take the consequences,
whatever they might be. Her love for
him was so deep, so passionate, so
overwhelming, he could not resist nor
stand against it. Had she only refused
to let him leave England, his marriage
would never have taken place. It had
been a cheat, a robbery, a fraud, and
such things never thrive. If they only
met—if she could only meet <span class="lock">him—he</span> and
his wife would both have to acknowledge
the truth of what she said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, she could gain no
news of the Earl of Ilfracombe, her
own act of supposed suicide having put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
the possibility of hearing of him out
of her reach. She could not come in
contact with him again without her
former position in his household being
made known. For this reason, as long
as she remained with her parents, Nell
saw no chance of seeing him. And it
was only at times that she desired it.
At others, she felt as if the sight of
her perfidious lover would kill her—as
if she would run miles the other way
sooner than encounter him; and these
were the despairing moments, when
she wept till she was nearly blind,
and made her mother rather impatient,
because she would not confess what
ailed her, nor say what she wanted.
The poor girl was passing through the
gates of hell, through which most of
us have to pass during our lifetime, in
which whoever enters must leave Hope
behind, for the portals are so dark and
gloomy that Hope could not exist there.
Some women will get over a disappointment
like this in a reasonable time;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
some never get over it at all; and Nell
Llewellyn was one of the latter. Her
very soul had entered into her love
for Lord Ilfracombe, and she could not
disentangle it. It had not been an
ordinary love with which she had regarded
him, but an ardent worship—such
worship as a devotee renders to
the God of his religion. I do not
say that such women never love again,
but they never forget the first love,
which is ready to revive at the first
opportunity, and which lives with them
all through the exercise of the second,
glorifying it, as it were, by the halo
thrown over it from the past.</p>

<p>Nell was still in a state of hopeless
collapse. She had not got over the
news of Ilfracombe’s marriage in the
slightest degree. She was perfectly aware
that he had shut the gates of Paradise
between them for evermore; yet she
often experienced this feverish anxiety
to learn from his own lips in what
light he regarded their separation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile her conscience occasionally
accused her of not having behaved as
kindly as she might to Hugh Owen—sometimes
gave her a sickening qualm
also, as she remembered she had parted
with her cherished secret to a man who
had apparently quarrelled with her ever
since. He had assured her it was safe
with him, but Nell felt that he despised
her for the confession she had made,
and might not his contempt lead him
to forget his promise? She wanted
further assurance that he would be
faithful and true.</p>

<p>She went over to the Dale Farm
far oftener than she had been wont to
do (which Hetty accepted entirely as a
compliment to her baby), in the hope
of encountering him; but he always managed
to slink away before she reached
the house, or to have some excuse for
leaving directly afterwards.</p>

<p>One afternoon, towards the end of May,
however, as she distinctly saw him hurrying
off through the fields at the back,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
with a book in his hand, Nell waited
till he was well out of sight, and then,
altering her course, turned also and followed
him up.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> country was in its full spring-tide
beauty. The hedges were gay with shepherds’
purse and pimpernel, and merry with
the song of birds rejoicing over their
young. The green meadows were dotted
over with the late lambs, skipping like
the high hills of Scripture; and as Nell
followed on Hugh Owen’s track, she trod
the sweet woodruffe under her feet.
A balmy, south-west wind blew on her
heated face, as she ran over the grassy
hill, up which he was slowly wending
his way, with his eyes bent on his book.
She had captured him at last. A long
stretch of grass land lay between them
yet, but there was no friendly copse or
orchard on the way in which he could
take shelter from her. Not that Hugh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
even knew of her approach. He had
seen her coming up the gravelled walk
that led to the Dale Farm, and slipped
out as usual by the back-door, in order
to avoid her. After her last words to
him, he thought his presence must be
as objectionable to Nell as hers was distressing
to him. That she should take
the trouble to follow him never entered
his head; so he went on slowly, poring
over his book, and was more startled
than she could imagine when he heard
a voice calling gaspingly after him,—‘Hugh!
Hugh!’ He turned round then,
to meet Nell’s beautiful face, flushed with
exertion, as she panted to come up with him.</p>

<p>‘Stop, Hugh! Stop a minute! I want
to speak to you,’ she said breathlessly.</p>

<p>He halted at her appeal, but he did not
smile as she reached his side.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Hugh, I have wanted to speak
to you for so long,’ said Nell, as they
stood opposite each other. ‘What is the
matter with you? Why do you never
come to Panty-cuckoo now?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>He looked at her with grave surprise.</p>

<p>‘Why do I never go to Panty-cuckoo
now?’ he repeated after her. ‘I should
have thought you were the last person
to ask me that question, Nell. Have
you forgotten the words with which you
sent me from you?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. What did I say? Anything very
dreadful? How little you must know of
women, to fancy they mean everything
they say. You made me angry, I suppose,
and then I resented it. But that
is four months ago. It’s ridiculous to
keep up a grudge all that time.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t think you were angry,’ replied
Hugh, in his low, sweet voice. ‘I think
you were in earnest, Nell, when you told
me to leave Panty-cuckoo Farm, and
never come back again; and that, after
what had passed between us, my presence
would be an extra pain to you. Was it
likely, after that, that I could intrude my
company on you? You must know that
I didn’t keep away from choice.’</p>

<p>‘No, I didn’t. I thought, perhaps, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
considered me altogether too bad to associate
with—that I should contaminate you
and make you unfit for the ministry, and
so it was your duty not to come near
me any more. That is what I
thought.’</p>

<p>‘How very little you know me,’ said
the young man with a sigh.</p>

<p>‘But mother and father are always
asking after you,’ continued Nell, hurriedly,
‘and wondering why you never
come near us; and it makes it rather
awkward for me, you know, Hugh. I
have told them all kinds of stories to
excuse your absence; but it would be
much better if you could come and see
the old people now and then. I would
keep out of the way, if you prefer it,
whilst you are there.’</p>

<p>He did not contradict her, only saying,—</p>

<p>‘I should be sorry to vex Mr and Mrs
Llewellyn, who have always been very
good to me. I hope they thought it was
my duties that kept me away. I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
not like them to know that you and I
have quarrelled.’</p>

<p>‘But <em>have</em> we quarrelled?’ said Nell,
wistfully. ‘Cannot we be friends still,
Hugh, as we were <span class="lock">before—before</span> your
last visit, you know? We are rather
sad up at Panty-cuckoo just now. Father
seems quite down-hearted about his farm.
Sir Archibald has decided to raise the
rent again, and father says he won’t be
able to make the place pay if he does.
Sometimes he talks of emigrating. Fancy
his doing that at his age! and, oftener,
the poor old man says he has lived too
long, and it will be a good day when he
is carried to Usk churchyard. And, what
with that, and—and—other things, I think
sometimes, Hugh, that life is altogether
too hard to bear; and it is a pity mine
wasn’t ended when I tried to end it!’</p>

<p>‘Poor Nell,’ said Hugh. ‘No, don’t
say that. If your life had not held
better things in store for you, surely the
Lord would not have given it back to
you twice running. But I must come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
over and talk to your father, and see if
I cannot cheer him up. If the worst
comes to the worst, Nell, I don’t see
why he should not try his fortune in
another country. He is not so very old—sixty
or thereabouts, I <span class="lock">think—and</span> he
will take his experience with him, and
sell it, maybe, to other men. There are
countries, as I daresay you have heard—like
Canada, for <span class="lock">instance—where</span> Government
gives the land away to men who
can cultivate it; and your father must
have a good sum of money sunk in his
stock and implements. With a little
money in hand, a man with knowledge
may do wonders in Canada or
New Zealand, and live out there as
long again as he would have done in
England.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Hugh, you are talking nonsense.
How would father and mother feel, uprooted
from the old place where they
have spent almost all their lives, and set
down in a strange country, without a
friend or acquaintance near them? They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
would die. They couldn’t stand it. It
would be too great a wrench.’</p>

<p>‘Would not <em>you</em> go with them?’ asked
Hugh dubiously.</p>

<p>‘<em>I?</em> Oh, yes, of course I should. But
what good should I be to them? Only
an extra burden. If father had a son it
would be different. But he would require
some strong young head and hand to
lift the greater part of the burden off his
shoulders.’</p>

<p>‘I agree with you. But don’t stand talking
here. You don’t look fit for that yet,
Nell. Surely you should be looking more
like your old self after all these months.
Sit down on this turf, it is quite dry, and
let us talk over what you have told me,
together.’</p>

<p>He held out his hand to her as he
spoke, and Nell availed herself of his
assistance to take a seat on the bank by
the side of the field.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Nell!’ he exclaimed as he released
it, ‘how hot your hand is, and how thin!
Do you feel weak?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>‘Not over strong,’ replied Nell, laughing
as they sat down, side by side. It
was true that she had hardly gained any
strength worth speaking of since her illness.
The wild longings she indulged in—the
regrets for her lost position, and
the remorse with which she was occasionally
attacked—were all working a
great and abiding change in her constitution.
The old people saw her going
about as usual, and never heard her complain;
so they thought she was all right,
and attributed any little languor or daintiness
on her part to her London schooling.
But Hugh, with a lover’s eye, perceived
the change in her vividly, and noted
with grief the hollowness of her eyes and
the attenuation of her hand.</p>

<p>‘My poor girl,’ he said tenderly, as he
gazed at her thin face, ‘what have you been
doing to yourself? You’ve been fretting
sorely, I’m afraid, Nell, since I saw you last.’</p>

<p>This direct appeal broke Nell down. No
one had given her such sympathy as this
before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, yes, Hugh, yes, I have,’ she cried.
‘I try so hard to forget, but it seems impossible.
I longed so much to come back
to Panty-cuckoo. I thought the beautiful,
quiet, peaceful country would heal my sore
wound, and help me to forget. But it
seems worse than the town. There, the
rattle and the noise might have shut out
other sounds. But here, in the peaceful
silence, I hear voices and see faces that I
want to shut out from my mind for ever.
Oh, it is very hard that, when one tries
and wishes to be good and do no wrong,
God should let the devil have such dominion
over us. Why is it, Hugh? Why
doesn’t He hear our prayers and let us forget?
Sometimes I feel as if I should go
mad in Panty-cuckoo, when I remember
the time when I was a little girl and went
black-berrying or nutting with you and the
other children, and remember those happy,
innocent days can never, <em>never</em> come over
again. Oh, Hugh, I feel as if I had been
in possession of untold wealth, and I had
deliberately thrown it away. Will it always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
be so? Shall I never be any better? Am I
to go on suffering like this to my life’s end?’</p>

<p>‘I hope not, Nell,’ replied the young
man. ‘You are not strong enough for
dairy and farm work, and it leaves your
brain too little to do, so it broods incessantly
upon the past. The work you want,
Nell, is head <span class="lock">work—something</span> by which
you will feel you are benefiting others.
That is the employment to bring peace
and forgetfulness in its train. You should
be a missionary, as I am.’</p>

<p>‘A missionary—I? Ah, now, Hugh, you
are laughing at me. A preacher should
have no sins to look back upon.’</p>

<p>‘Then there would be no preachers in
the world, Nell. I say, on the contrary,
that no one can teach others till he himself
has been taught of God. He cannot
relieve suffering, unless he, too, has suffered.
He cannot know the enormity of
sin, nor the trouble it brings in its train,
till he himself has sinned as we all have,
and if any man says he has not, he lies
before the God who made him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>‘But not like I have,’ said poor Nell,
with her face hidden in her hands.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you think, Nell,’ said Hugh,
‘when you remember all the suffering and
shame and remorse that your sin has
brought you, that you could speak very
forcibly to any girl whom you saw in danger
of running the same risk? Would not
you, out of the kindness of your woman’s
heart, warn her not to do as you have
done, and point out to her the pain that
must succeed it?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes, of course I could and would,
Hugh. It would be very cruel not to
do so.’</p>

<p>‘Then, you see, you <em>are</em> fit for a missionary.
You said just now that, if your
father had a son to accompany him to
a new country, emigration would be a
different thing for him. Well, if he
elects to go, <em>I</em> am willing to accompany
him, and to be, as far as in me lies, as a
son to <span class="lock">him—aiding</span> him all I can with
my strong young arm and <span class="lock">head—on</span> one
condition.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>‘What is the condition, Hugh?’ asked
Nell.</p>

<p>‘That you will come, too, as my wife
and helper. If you consent, I will show
you a way to heal your sore hurt, that
shall bring you the utmost peace at last.
I don’t promise you happiness, though I
would try hard to secure you that also;
but peace I know you will have, for God
will send it. Come with me, and be my
helper and companion. We will go to
some country, so widely different from
England that nothing in it shall ever have
the power to remind you of the terrible
experience you have passed through here;
and in a warmer climate you will, I hope,
regain the health and strength which you
have lost. Do you remember how you
told me long ago that I was cut out for a
missionary, and you were right. The very
thought warms my blood. We will go to
South Africa, or anywhere that is considered
best for us all, and I will devote my life
to securing the happiness of yours. Will
you come?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>Nell turned round and looked at him with
astonishment.</p>

<p>‘Will I go to South Africa with you as
your wife? Hugh, do you know what you
are asking me?’</p>

<p>‘Exactly. I am asking you the same
thing I asked you four months ago, and
you refused.’</p>

<p>‘But you thought I was a different girl
then from what you know now. I have
told you all. I—I—am—’</p>

<p>And here she faltered, and looked down
at the blades of grass she was twisting
about in her hands.</p>

<p>‘Let there be no misunderstanding
between us, Nell. Let me finish the
sentence for you, and don’t be offended
at what I say, for I speak plainly, so that
you may be sure that I do not deceive
myself any more than you. I know now
that you have parted with the greatest
glory of your unmarried womanhood; that
you have, what the world calls, fallen; that
you lived in a state of sin for three long
years, knowing it to be sin, and wished for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
no better lot; and that even at this moment
you would go back to that condition if you
could. Do I speak too plainly, my dear?
Do I hurt you?’</p>

<p>Nell shook her head, but did not answer
him in words.</p>

<p>‘Well, then, you see there is no need
for you to tell me anything; and if there
were the remotest chance of your being
tempted to go back to that life, or if the
man you cared for were in a position to
marry you, I would not dare ask you to
share my lot. But there is no chance of
either of these things occurring to you.
The only future I can see before you is,
to live in this simple place where you will
have no distraction from your sad thoughts,
and where maybe you will eventually die,
from fretting after the impossible, or from
remorse for that which can never be undone
again. If you can make up your
mind to leave England with me, I think
I can save you much of this. I think I
can lead your thoughts to dwell on something
better than your past life, and renovate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
your health by diverting them. I
think that, with the help of God and time,
I may be able to show you a way out of
all this terrible trouble that bids fair to
blight your youth, and live, perhaps, to
hear you acknowledge that it was permitted
in mercy to make you better able
to sympathise with the sin and sufferings
of your fellow-creatures. This is what I
hope for, Nell; but I may be presumptuous
in hoping it after all.’</p>

<p>‘And you would make <em>me</em> your wife,
Hugh; knowing all and hating all, as you
do. Oh, it is impossible. You are too
good for me. I am not worthy to marry
you. I told you so from the first.’</p>

<p>‘We need not talk of worthiness or
unworthiness to one another,’ answered
Hugh. ‘We are man and woman, and I
love you. That is quite enough. The
matter lies between ourselves alone. No
one else will ever hear of it.’</p>

<p>‘Ah Hugh, forgive me, but I <em>don’t</em>
love you. Therein lies all the difference.
I will not deceive you in the slightest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
particular. My heart still clings to, and
is wrapped up in this—this—man. I cannot
forget him. I cannot un-love him. For
three long happy years he taught me to
regard him as my husband, and the fact
that he never married me in church
makes no difference to my affection.
I am <span class="lock">sorry—I</span> grieve deeply night and
day that he has left me in so cruel a
manner, but still I love him. I am more
like a widow than a wicked girl. I suppose
it is part of my wickedness—the
greatest part <span class="lock">perhaps—that</span> I <em>cannot</em> feel
how wicked I have been. I only know
that my husband has left me for another
woman, and that he cannot have realised
what my love for him was, or he never
would have done it. Is that very wicked?’
said Nell, as she looked up into the
young man’s face.</p>

<p>The answer he made her was very different
from what she expected of him.</p>

<p>‘No, Nell, it is not wicked. If I had
not known that <em>that</em> was the way in which
you regarded the past I would not have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
asked you to be my wife. But the heart
that can be so faithful to one man—the
man who has betrayed <span class="lock">it—will</span> be as
faithful to another when once its tears are
dried for the first. I, too, look on you
as a widow, as something far more to be
pitied than a widow. But it is all over
now, my poor girl. You know that without
my telling you; so, whether you can
forget it or not, let me try to make the
remainder of your life useful and happy.
Will you, Nell?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Hugh, you are too good. I never
knew anyone so good and kind in all
my life before. If—if—we went far away
from England and all its dreadful associations,
where we should hardly ever hear
its name again, I think I could be happy,
or at least contented with you as my
friend. And if, Hugh, it was some little
time before I could think of you in any
other light than that of a friend you
would not be angry, would you? You
would be a little patient with me, and
remember how much I have suffered—how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
hardly I have been <span class="lock">used—until</span> I
feel as if I could never trust to a man’s
promises again.’</p>

<p>‘If you will come with me to South
Africa and help me in my missionary
work, Nell,’ said Hugh, as he took the
listless hand hanging down by her side
and pressed it softly, ‘I will never ask
you for the affection nor the duty of a
wife till you can tell me that you are
ready and willing to give it me. Will
you trust me so <span class="lock">far—that</span> if the love I
long for should never spring up in your
heart for me I will never demand it, nor
worry you because it is not there, but
still do my utmost to teach you how to
lighten your heavy burden by working for
God and God’s creatures? Do you believe
me? Will you trust me?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Hugh, yes. I will trust you
through everything. And if father and
mother should elect to emigrate and leave
the dear old farm for good and all, why,
I will go with them and <span class="lock">you—as</span> your
wife.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>And she held out her hand to him as
she concluded. Hugh seized it, and carried
it to his lips.</p>

<p>‘You have made me so happy!’ he exclaimed.
‘Oh, Nell, whether as friends, or
as husband and wife, you are <em>my</em> Nell
now for evermore, and I will never let
you go again.’</p>

</div>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">As</span> Nell walked back to Panty-cuckoo
alone (for she would not let Hugh accompany
her) she could not decide if she
were pleased or sorry at what had taken
place between them. Certainly she did
not realise it. She was as much Lord
Ilfracombe’s widow as she had been on
setting out, and did not feel like the
betrothed of anybody. But one thing did
seem to please <span class="lock">her—the</span> idea of leaving
England and all its sad associations behind,
and going to a new country, to live
amidst new surroundings and new people.
Her heart had been growing faint and
sick with England for a long time past.
To go to South Africa; to sail on the
sea; to see the wondrous vegetation that
adorns <span class="lock">it—the</span> hedges of cacti, the bowers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
of orange-trees, the ostriches and the
gorillas; all the wonders, in fact, of which
she had read in the books which Hugh
had lent <span class="lock">her—this</span> was what she thought
of most as she wended her way slowly
homewards. If an occasional remembrance
struck her that they could not be
enjoyed without the accompaniment of
Hugh’s society she put it from her with
a slight frown, and fell to thinking of
the other instead. Hugh had said he
would not worry her; that she should do
exactly as she pleased; that he would ask
nothing from her till she was ready to
grant it; and Hugh was a man of his
word. He would not say one thing and
do another. She was quite safe with him.
They would go out to Africa together, and
whilst he taught the men and preached
to them she would be kind and helpful to
the mothers and the little black children,
and show them how to make their clothes,
and take care of their health, and cook
their food. She pictured herself clad in a
white dress, with a broad straw hat on,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
walking amongst her sable sisters, nursing
them when they were sick, or joining in
their merry-makings and festivities. She
could better forget there, Nell said to herself,
than in a country that reminded her at
every turn of what she had lost. And
Hugh was very good to her, there was
no doubt of that, and would guard and
protect her from further evil till her life’s
end. He knew her secret, and he did not
despise her for it, that was more than
she could say for anybody else. Even
the servants in Grosvenor Square, over
whom she had reigned supreme, had shown
her, but too plainly, as soon as they dared,
that they considered her a little lower
than themselves. She dared not think
what her father and mother and Hetty
would say if they were made cognisant of
the truth. Nell knew her parents’ strict
ideas on propriety too well. Her mother
would upbraid her for having brought the
first shame into their virtuous family—her
father would, in all probability, turn
her out of the house, and tell her her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
presence contaminated both her mother
and her sister. The poor, when virtuous,
are very virtuous indeed. They cannot
understand the temptations of the upper
classes and those who are thrown in contact
with them, because they are not
subjected to the same themselves. What
working man has the leisure to go after
his neighbour’s wife? When his day’s
labour is over he is too tired to go
courting, to say nothing of the fact that
his neighbour’s task is over at the same
time, and he is keeping safe guard over
his sheepfold. No, her own people would
show no sympathy for her disgrace! Nell
was quite aware of that. Hugh, who was
so good himself and a minister of the
gospel, was the only one she would have
dared tell her story to, and he could so
far overlook it as to wish to make her
his wife. She owed Hugh something, and
some day, perhaps, she might repay the
debt. At present, however, what had passed
between them was to remain with themselves.
She had made him promise that.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
She felt if it were made public property
she could never get out of it again.
What with the Owens and the Llewellyns
she would be forced into a marriage, to
think of which made her shudder. Things
must go on exactly as usual, till she
knew what was going to happen at Panty-cuckoo
Farm, and then, if her father
decided to emigrate (which was by no
means likely at present), it would be time
for her to make up her mind. Meanwhile,
it all seemed a long way off, and Nell felt
easier for the concession she had accorded
Hugh. She had experienced so many
qualms as to whether she had been wise
in placing confidence in him, but now there
was no doubt that he would respect her
secret for his own sake as well as hers.
So she went back to Panty-cuckoo Farm
in better spirits than she had displayed
for some time past, and found her mother
in close converse with Mrs Hody, the
housekeeper from Usk Hall. The two
women had tea spread before them, and were
evidently going in for a regular ‘confab.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>‘Going to raise the rents again,’ old
Mrs Hody was saying as Nell walked into
the room. ‘Well, I never. I wonder Mr
Bastian, the steward, didn’t tell me of it.
I expect he was too much ashamed. Not
that it’s his doing, poor man. He can
only follow the master’s lead. But, dear
me, Mrs Llewellyn, it’s easy to guess who
is at the bottom of it. It’s my lady’s
high jinks and no mistake. It would take
twice Sir Archibald’s money to cover
them. Now, there’s all new papering to
be put up in the bedrooms. I’m sure the
paper was good enough for anybody. It’s
not been up more than a couple o’ years,
but there’s to be a grand party at the
hall this summer, and I suppose nothing
is too good for ’em.’</p>

<p>‘When are the family coming home, Mrs
Hody?’ asked Nell.</p>

<p>‘Next month, my lass, and you’d better
get your best gowns ready, for there’s to
be a power of young gentlemen with them
and no mistake. I’ve just been talking to
your mother here about her rooms. I wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
she could let us have the use of four, just
for a month or two, for where I’m to put
them all I don’t know.’</p>

<p>‘But it is impossible, Mrs Hody, or I’d
willingly oblige you. But you know I
couldn’t do it even before my Nell came
home, and it is more impossible than ever
now.’</p>

<p>‘I could lend you the furniture,’ said
the housekeeper, coaxingly, ‘if that’s the
obstacle. We’ve got enough stowed away
at the top of the house to furnish five or
six rooms. We make up sixteen beds ourselves,
but they’ll be all full. Whatever
they can want with such a heap of guests
beats me. I’ve been up the village this
afternoon to see if the Wilkins’ or Turners’
girls were at home, for we shall want
extra help, but, like my luck, they’re all
in service.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps our Nell here might be of use
to you, Mrs Hody,’ interposed Mrs Llewellyn.
‘She’s been used to service, you
know, and I guess she’s a good hand at
it. What say, Nell? Will ye go up to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
the Hall and help Mrs Hody when the
folks arrive?’</p>

<p>Nell grew scarlet. What if some of the
‘folks’ should have seen her in London
and recognise her!</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, mother,’ she exclaimed, shrinking
back, ‘I couldn’t! I don’t know enough
about it. I’ve never been in any place,
remember, except in the nursery and then
as housekeeper. I have never done any
housework or cooking.’</p>

<p>Mrs Hody looked at the girl’s beautiful
face suspiciously.</p>

<p>‘You’re very young for a housekeeper,
especially since you can have had no previous
experience. Who engaged you for the place?’</p>

<p>‘Lord Ilfracombe,’ replied Nell timidly—she
always became timid when the earl
was alluded to.</p>

<p>‘And what aged man was he, my dear?’
continued Mrs Hody.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t <span class="lock">know—somewhere</span> between
twenty and thirty, I suppose; quite young,
of course, but I hardly ever saw him. He
was often absent from home.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>‘And how did the servants like taking
their orders from such a lass as you?
Didn’t they give you trouble sometimes?’
went on her inquisitor.</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, they were all old servants.
They knew their duty,’ said Nell confusedly,
and then she added, to hide her
embarrassment,—‘But do tell me, Mrs
Hody, the names of some of the visitors
you are expecting. It is such an event
to see strangers in Usk. Are there lords
and ladies amongst them?’</p>

<p>‘Lords and ladies, my dear. Why,
they’re most all lords and ladies this time,
asked on purpose to meet a royal prince,
who has condescended to stay for a week
with Sir Archibald. Lor’! what a fuss
my lady will make over him, to be sure.
I expect she’s half wild with joy that he
is coming. And there’ll be more cards and
high play than ever, I suppose, and turning
night into day, as I’ve just been telling
your good mother. No one in bed till
two or three in the morning, and candles
left guttering all over the tablecloths, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
wine spilt over the carpets, and there—it
makes me sick to talk of it. I do declare
if the play goes on this time as it did
last year, I shall give Sir Archibald warning.
It’s scandalous! I did hear as one
poor <span class="lock">man—Captain</span> Trelany was his name—was
quite ruined by it, and has been
obliged to sell out of his regiment in consequence
and go abroad. Such a wicked
thing for a man of Sir Archibald’s age
to encourage in his house, but there! it’s
all <em>her</em> fault. She don’t go on a bit like
a married lady, and I don’t care who
hears me say so. A running after gents
as she does, screaming and laughing like
a schoolgirl, and driving over the place
like a mad woman. I’m sure I wish
sometimes I’d never set eyes on her face.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, I’m glad our Nell has nothing
to do with such,’ said Mrs Llewellyn, ‘for
it must be a bad example for a young
girl. My daughters have been brought
up steady and respectable, and if I thought
they would ever take to such ways, it
would break my heart.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>‘What gentlemen are you going to send
to mother, Mrs Hody?’ said Nell to turn
the conversation.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know yet, my dear, but they
are sure to be bachelors, so don’t you
listen to any nonsense they may say to
you. Young gentlemen are not half
particular enough in these days. They
talk a lot of rubbish to a pretty girl
and mean nothing by it, whilst she
maybe takes it all for gospel truth, and
cries her eyes out when she finds it was
only their fun. Men always have been
took, and always will be took by a
pretty face to the end of time, and think
it’s an honour for any poor girl to receive
notice from them; but don’t you believe
nothing they may say to you,
Nell, for gentlemen marry for money
now-a-days and nothing else it strikes
me.’</p>

<p>But at this adjuration Mrs Llewellyn
ruffled up her feathers like an old hen when
her chickens are attacked.</p>

<p>‘You needn’t come for to give such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
advice to any girl of mine, Mrs Hody!’
she exclaimed, quite hotly, ‘for it isn’t
needed. Believe any rubbish a gentleman
born might say to her! I should think not,
indeed. Nell is much too sensible for
that. She knows that gentleman’s compliments
mean no good for poor girls, and
would not encourage such a thing for a
moment. My lasses are not like the
Simpsons, Mrs Hody, nor yet the Manleys.
They’ve never been allowed to run
loose for anyone to talk to, but been
reared in a God-fearing way and taught
that His eye is on them everywhere.
There’s no occasion for you to caution
them. I can assure you, I would rather
see Nell stretched dead at my feet, than
think her capable of such folly. Why,
who knows what it might lead to?
Gentlemen have flattering tongues sometimes
for country girls, and put all sorts
of silly ideas into their heads. If I
thought our Nell would even speak to
such lodgers as you may choose to send
us, Mrs Hody, I wouldn’t let my rooms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
to you, not if you gave me ten pounds a
week for them, there!’</p>

<p>And Mrs Llewellyn, quite exhausted by
her efforts, stopped talking and wiped her
steaming face with her apron.</p>

<p>‘Oh, mother, dear, why make so much
of it?’ said Nell, with cheeks of crimson.
‘I am sure Mrs Hody never thought
that I or Hetty would behave ourselves
in an unseemly way with your lodgers.
It was only a kindly caution on her part.
And you need have no fear for me,
believe me.’</p>

<p>‘No, indeed, Mrs Llewellyn,’ interposed
the housekeeper, anxious to make
peace with her hostess, ‘I only put in
my little word on account of your Nell
here being so handsome, and I, knowing
but too well what some of the gentlemen
as come to the Hall are. Why,
didn’t one of ’em wrong poor little
Katie Brown only last autumn twelvemonth,
stuffing the poor child’s head up
with some nonsense about marriage not
being necessary, and that he’d stick to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
her all his life, and then going off when
the shooting was over and leaving her
with a baby at her back. Tom Brown
was after bringing an action against the
gentleman—Mr Frank Leyton, it was—and
getting some money out of him for
his daughter’s shame; but the lawyer
advised him not, for there was no evidence
except Katie’s word, and that
wouldn’t be enough in a court of justice,
he said. I’ve taken good care not to
have any pretty girls about the Hall
since, and if your Nell had come up
to help me, I would have kept her
out of their way, for such a set of unprincipled
vagabonds I never see before!’</p>

<p>‘No, thank you, Mrs Hody,’ replied
Mrs Llewellyn, grandly, ‘no amount
of wages would make me send a girl
of mine up to the Hall after what
you’ve told me. My daughters have
been very humbly born and bred, but
they are good, virtuous lassies, though,
perhaps, I should not be the one to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
say it. It would break my heart if I
could think them capable of taking up
with folks as never meant to marry
them, and as for their father, well, I
do believe he’d take a gun and shoot
’em if he knew of it. So, our Nell,
she’ll keep down at Panty-cuckoo, if
you please, whilst your family’s at home,
and do her duty by keeping the lodgers’
rooms clean and tidy, instead of making
the acquaintance of their occupants.’</p>

<p>‘There, there, mother, say no more
about it, pray!’ cried Nell in real distress,
as she carried off the tea-tray
in order to hide her burning cheeks.</p>

<p>It was such conversations as these
that made her fearful to think what
might happen if her secret ever became
known to her parents; which made
her contemplate the thought of South
Africa with something very much like
gratitude, and even remember the condition
attached to it without a shudder.
She had quite made up her mind by
this time that she should never see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
the Earl of Ilfracombe again. She had
never heard him mention Usk, nor even
Wales. It was not likely, in her simple
ideas, that he would ever find his way
there; she thought that they were
as widely separated as if the sea divided
them. She had but two alternatives—either
to end her days at Panty-cuckoo
Farm, in the maddeningly quiet manner
she was passing them now, or to become
Hugh Owen’s wife and go away with
him, far, far from everything that could
possibly remind her of the happy,
thoughtless time she had believed would
never end; and, of the two, the last
appeared to be the best to her. Yet
not without her parents. That was,
of course, plainly understood between
Hugh and herself. But her father
still talked despondingly of his prospects,
and of the ultimate necessity of his making
some change, and Nell seemed to
see the future looming before her, even
though it was as yet no larger than a
man’s hand. Hugh Owen had resumed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
his visits to the farm, much to the content
of Mrs Llewellyn, and, sometimes,
he and Nell took a stroll together in
the summer evenings. Only as friends,
though. Notwithstanding the half promise
she had made him, Nell would not
permit him to consider himself anything
more than her friend until the matter
was finally settled between them, and
the young man was quite content it
should be so. Perhaps he required a
little time also, to recover the great shock
experienced on hearing Nell’s story,
and preferred to gain her complete confidence
and friendship before asking for
any closer privilege. But he was happy
in knowing that she trusted him, and
never doubted but that the end for both
of them would be a perfect union.</p>

<p>So the time went on until May was
over, and Mrs Hody announced that
she would require Mrs Llewellyn’s bedrooms
for two gentlemen on the following
day. The task of preparing them
was confided to Nell. There was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
rough work to be <span class="lock">done—Mrs</span> Llewellyn’s
rooms being always kept in spick-and-span
order—but the linen sheets had
to be taken out of the old walnut-wood
press, where they had lain for the last
year between sprigs of sweet lavender,
and aired before the kitchen fire, and
the creases ironed out before they were
put upon the beds. Then the fair
white toilet-covers, trimmed with lace
made by the farmer’s great-grandmother,
were spread upon the dressing-tables
and chest of drawers, and every speck
of dust flicked off the polished furniture.
Clean lace curtains were hung before
the windows, about which clambered
the honeysuckles and roses, which poor
Nell used to see in her London dreams,
and before which lay the beds of flowers
which adorned the side of the farmhouse.
These two rooms, as has been
said before, lay apart from the rest
of the domain, and opened into the
bricked passage at the back of the parlour.
They had a little private entrance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
of their own, and, when they were
occupied, the lodgers were allowed to
come in and out as they chose. This
was absolutely necessary with the guests
of Sir Archibald Bowmant, as the revelries
of Usk Hall were kept up so late,
that the Llewellyns could not possibly
have sat up for them. So, in that
primitive place, where latch-keys were
unknown and robbery was unheard of,
the simple farmers left their side-door
unfastened, and scarcely ever set eyes
on their lodgers. When the two sleeping
chambers were clad in their white
adornments, Nell fancied they looked
too cold and colourless, so she fetched
some old-fashioned vases of blue china from
her mother’s store closet, and filled them
with roses and lilies, overshadowed by
graceful branches of crimson fuchsias
and tufts of sword grass. She placed
one upon each toilet-table, and heaved
a sigh to see how pure and sweet and
clean the rooms looked, like an unstained
conscience in the bosom of a child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>‘Nell! Nell!’ called her mother, from
the parlour, ‘open the side-door, there’s
a good lass. There’s one of the Hall
gardeners bringing over the gentlemen’s
luggage.’</p>

<p>Nell did as she was desired, and encountered
a man with some portmanteaus,
and bags and plaids in a wheelbarrow
standing outside the door.</p>

<p>‘These are the things, miss, of the
gents as is to sleep here,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘All right. Bring them in,’ was the
reply.</p>

<p>The man brought the articles in, one
by one, on his shoulders, and heaped them
all down in the first room.</p>

<p>‘But stay!’ exclaimed Nell, ‘some must
go in the other room. What are the
gentlemen’s names?’</p>

<p>‘Sure, I don’t know, miss. All I was
told was to bring the luggage over
here.’</p>

<p>Nell examined the portmanteaus first.
On one were the initials M. L., on the
other J. S. P. One bag had M. L. on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
it, the other was blank. The two bundles
of plaids and umbrellas were not addressed
at all.</p>

<p>‘Take that portmanteau and that bag,’
said Nell, intimating the two marked
M. L. ‘into the next room, and leave
the others here. The gentlemen can sort
their own plaids when they come.’</p>

<p>The man did as she told him, and
withdrew, as Mrs Llewellyn came bustling
into the room to see if the luggage betokened
wealth or not.</p>

<p>‘Nice portmantles, ain’t they, Nell?’ she
remarked, as she examined the locks and
leather. ‘Lor’! what a lot of money
young gentlemen do spend on themselves.
M. L. I fancy I’ve seen him before. I
think that must be Mr Martin Lennox,
who was down the year before last. Such
a nice, free-spoken young man, and will
be an earl some day they told me.
J. S. P.,’ she went on, looking at the
other portmanteau, ‘I’ve never seen that
before. I wonder what it stands <span class="lock">for—J</span>.
S. P.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>‘What letters did you say?’ asked Nell
curiously.</p>

<p>‘J. S. P., my dear. John something,
I suppose. However, it don’t matter to
us, so long as they don’t make too much
noise when they come home at night.
There was one gentleman we had once
who was dreadful. He wasn’t content with
singing all sorts of songs as soon as he
got into his room, but he must go for
dancing, and he used to make such a row
and keep it up so late, that at last father
and I could stand it no longer, and were
obliged to speak to Sir Archibald. There
was no rest for anyone, and when you have
to be up at five o’clock, that’s no joke.
So Sir Archibald was very good about it,
and sent us a quieter gentleman instead.’</p>

<p>But Nell had heard nothing of her
mother’s discourse. She was kneeling
down by the portmanteau marked J. S. P.,
and examining it all over.</p>

<p>‘What do you see there, my lass?’ said
Mrs Llewellyn. ‘What’s the matter with
it? Anything gone wrong?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>‘No, mother, <span class="lock">nothing—nothing</span>,’ replied
the girl, as she rose to her feet
again.</p>

<p>She was wondering what there was in
the stranger’s portmanteau that seemed
so familiar to <span class="lock">her—where</span> she could
have seen it <span class="lock">before—for</span> what name the
initials J. S. P. stood? The intermediate
letter prevented her grasping the truth at
once. She had never associated it with
the other two. But something about the
luggage seemed to bring an old memory
with it, and made her feel uneasy. Could
it possibly belong to someone whom she
had met in Grosvenor Square? or at
Thistlemere?—anyone who might recognise
her as having been in Lord Ilfracombe’s
household? The thought made
her turn cold with apprehension.</p>

<p>‘Both these bundles of shawls can’t
belong to one gentleman, Nell,’ said her
mother presently. ‘Come and take one
into the other room. Ay, but that’s a
beauty. And what a pretty plaid, too—green
and orange and blue. Wouldn’t I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
like just such another to keep my feet
warm when father drives me to market at
Newport. Carry it carefully, lass. Don’t
let the straps get loose, or maybe the
gentleman will be annoyed.’</p>

<p>But Nell had already let the plaid of
green and orange and blue fall to the
ground. She recognised it now; she recognised
the initials also. They both belonged
to Mr John Portland. The
thought made her head whirl. She sat
down on the floor to recover herself.</p>

<p>‘Eh, Nell, my lass, but you’re faint,’
cried her mother. ‘Don’t sit on the bed,
child, for mercy’s sake. You’ll ruin the look
of the sheets; but get into the parlour as
quick as you can. Why, what ails you?
You were looking ever so well this morning.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, mother, and I’m all right now,’
said Nell, as she made an effort to raise
herself. ‘The day’s warm, you know, and
I’m only a little tired. I’ll be better when
I’ve had my dinner. I don’t think there’s
anything more to be done to the rooms
now, so I’ll go and look after my own,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
and so she escaped to the shelter of her
bedroom. But when she had time to
consider the scare she had received, she
was ready to call herself a fool for having
been frightened so easily.</p>

<p>‘The initials are certainly his,’ she
thought, ‘and I’m almost sure he had a
plaid something like that one; but, after
all, I cannot be certain, and the initials
J. P. might fit half a hundred names—John
Platt, or James Philpott, or Joseph
Plowden. It is silly of me to make
sure they belong to Mr Portland until I
have better proof. What should he be
doing here in Usk? I never heard him
mention the place, nor the name of Sir
Archibald. I saw so much of him, they
would have been sure to crop up some
time or other. Oh, I have been frightening
myself with a bogey. I am sure I
have. How weak my nerves must have
become. I was never like this in the old
days,’ and Nell heaved a deep sigh as she
spoke. Still, as the day drew to a close,
and the owners of the portmanteaus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
might be expected to arrive at any
moment to dress for dinner, she grew
so nervous she could not stay in the
house. The first person she encountered
outside it was Hugh Owen, come to see
if she would go for a country walk with
him.</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Nell decidedly; ‘I can’t walk
to-night. Mother wants me, and I have
work to do indoors.’</p>

<p>‘Have you heard that all the company’s
arrived at the Hall?’ demanded
Hugh; ‘six carriages full, the gardener
told me, and as many more expected
to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘Of course I know it,’ replied the girl
petulantly; ‘we’ve two of them coming
to sleep at the farm to-night. Do you
know who they are?’</p>

<p>‘No, I heard no names, except those
of Sir Archibald and Lady Bowmant.
What is it that is keeping you indoors,
Nell?’ asked Hugh.</p>

<p>‘Nothing that concerns you,’ she
answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>He looked surprised at her manner,
but did not notice it openly.</p>

<p>‘I thought, if it wouldn’t take you long,
you might come out a little later. A walk
would do you good. You are looking
very pale.’</p>

<p>‘No, I shall not go out this evening,’
she replied. ‘I’m tired, and want to be
quiet and by myself.’</p>

<p>‘That means I’m to go then, dear,’
he said wistfully.</p>

<p>‘That’s as you please, Hugh. Mother’s
indoors, and always glad to see you, you
know that without my telling you, but
I’m too busy to have any more time to
spare. Good-night.’</p>

<p>She held out her hand to him in token
of farewell, and he was fain to accept
it and take his leave of her. But, intuitively,
he felt more upset than the
occasion demanded. He walked on
further towards a neighbouring village,
and did not return till an hour later.
Then he distinguished in the gloaming
a white dress cross the road, and go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
towards the Hall by way of the fields.
Hugh felt sure that the dress belonged
to Nell, and yet she had told him she
should not leave the farm that night.
And what should she want up at the
Hall, too, just as the family had returned
to it, when she never went near Mrs
Hody for weeks together when the house
was empty. Hugh puzzled over this
enigma for a long time without coming
to a satisfactory solution, but he turned
into Panty-cuckoo Farm just to see if
his suspicion was correct. Meanwhile
Nell was creeping up to the Hall by a
back way to gain an audience of old
Mrs Hody while the family was at
dinner. She felt she must know the
best, or the worst, before she slept that
night.</p>

<p>‘Mrs Hody,’ she said, as she burst
in upon that worthy, making a comfortable
tea off all the tit-bits that came
down from her master’s table, ‘mother
sent me up to ask you if the gentlemen
will take tea or coffee in the morning.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>‘Lor’! my dear, neither I should say.
What will they want with troubling
your mother about such things. If
they’ve been used to it, her ladyship
will order me to send it down for them
from the Hall. I wonder whatever put
such an idea into her head.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, she thought it best to make
sure,’ replied the girl, ‘and please, what
are their names?’</p>

<p>‘The gentlemen’s names? Why, one
is the Honourable Mr Lennox, and the
other is a Mr Portland.’</p>

<p>‘Portland?’ exclaimed Nell. ‘Are you
sure? <em>Portland?</em>’</p>

<p>‘Yes, my girl, I’m quite sure. Mr
John Portland, though I’ve never seen
him at the Hall before. He comes from
London, I believe. Sir Archibald’s always
picking up strangers, and bringing them
here to eat their heads off at his expense.
Well, some folks have queer
notions of pleasure. Haven’t they? Oh,
you’re off. Well, give my respects to
your mother, and tell her to mind and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
keep all her spare cream and chickens
for the Hall, for I’ll want everything she
can send me.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, I will tell her,’ replied Nell,
in a muffled voice, as she turned away
repeating in her inmost heart,—‘What <em>shall</em>
I do? What <em>shall</em> I do?’</p>

<p>As she walked into the farm parlour,
she encountered Hugh Owen, who looked
at her through and through.</p>

<p>‘Well my lass,’ began Mrs Llewellyn,
‘here’s Hugh waiting for you, you see,
so I’m glad you’re come. He’s been
main patient, sitting here for the best
part of an hour.’</p>

<p>‘Well, good-night,’ said Nell, making
for the door that led to her chamber.</p>

<p>‘Why, won’t you stop and talk to
him a bit now you have come?’ remonstrated
her mother.</p>

<p>‘I have already told Hugh that I
have no time for talking to him to-night,’
replied Nell, without arresting her footsteps.</p>

<p>‘And you told me, also, that you were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
not going to leave the farm to-night,
Nell,’ said the young man, with the least
bit of reproach in his tone.</p>

<p>She turned round on him with unnecessary
fierceness.</p>

<p>‘And what is it to you if I do or
not? Are you my keeper? Am I
obliged to account to you for my actions?
My father and mother are the only people
who have any right to find fault with
me, or to regulate my goings-out or
comings-in, and I do not hold myself responsible
to anyone else. You are taking
too much upon yourself, Hugh. For the
future, I shall refuse to tell you anything.’</p>

<p>And she flew upstairs, leaving both her
mother and Hugh Owen in a state of
consternation at such an unusual exhibition
of temper on her part.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Christmas</span> was over; the Countess Dowager
and the Ladies Devenish had taken their
departure from Thistlemere; the weather
was inclement, and a great deal of time
had to be spent indoors; which made
Nora often wish that she and her husband
were alone. One day she expressed something
of the kind to him. She said,—</p>

<p>‘I thought people usually kept their
country seats for the purposes of retirement,
but we have never been alone since
we came here.’</p>

<p>Ilfracombe laughed.</p>

<p>‘Why, my darling, what do you call
us at the present moment? We couldn’t
well be much more alone.’</p>

<p>‘Mr Portland is here,’ replied the
countess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>‘Old Jack! You don’t call him anybody,
surely? He’s as much at home at
Thistlemere as we are. I wish he would
live here altogether. I don’t know what
I shall do when he <em>does</em> go. I shall be
lost without my old chum to smoke with
and talk to.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t think you need anticipate any
such calamity,’ said Nora, with something
of her old, sharp manner. ‘Mr Portland
does not appear to have the slightest
intention of moving.’</p>

<p>‘He <em>was</em> thinking of it, though. He
had a letter yesterday, which he said
obliged him to return to town, but I
persuaded him to write instead. It would
be awfully dull for me if he went away, just
at this time when there is nothing going on.’</p>

<p>‘Complimentary to <em>me</em>,’ retorted the
young countess, with a shrug.</p>

<p>‘Now, my darling, you know what I
mean. You are all the world to me—a
part of <span class="lock">myself—but</span> you can’t sit up till
the small hours playing billiards and smoking
cigars with me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>‘No. I draw the line at cigars,
Ilfracombe.’</p>

<p>‘And then, how many rainy and dirty
days there are, when you only feel inclined
to sit over the fire and toast your
pretty little feet. What would become
of me then, if Jack were not here to
go potting rabbits, or turning the rats
out of the barns with the terriers. The
country is so frightfully dull at this time of
year, you would be bored to death with
only me to talk to.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think so, Ilfracombe?’</p>

<p>‘I feel sure of it, and how should we
pass the evenings without our whist?
Babbage is the only man within hail of
us who thinks it worth his while to come
over for a game; so if Jack were not
good enough to exile himself for the pleasure
of our company, we should be
obliged to import someone else, who would
probably not play half so well.’</p>

<p>Lord and Lady Ilfracombe were riding
together at the time of this conversation,
walking their horses slowly round the lanes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
about Thistlemere, for Nora was not an
experienced horsewoman. She had had no
opportunity of either riding or driving in
Malta, and her husband was employing
his leisure by teaching her something of
both arts. She was a pupil to be proud
of; plucky in the extreme, and only a
little reckless and disposed to imagine
she could do it all at once, which kept
the earl on constant tenter-hooks about
her. As he finished speaking to her now,
she exclaimed rather impatiently,—</p>

<p>‘Oh, very well, let us say no more
about it,’ and struck the spirited little
mare she was riding sharply across the
neck with her whip.</p>

<p>The animal started and set off suddenly
at a hard gallop, nearly unseating her
rider by the rapidity of her action. The
earl followed, in an access of alarm until
he saw that the mare had settled down
into a moderate canter again.</p>

<p>‘Nora, my darling!’ he exclaimed, as
he came up with her, ‘you mustn’t do
that. Leila won’t stand it. She will throw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
you some day to a dead certainty. You
gave me a pretty fright, I can tell you.
What should I do if you were thrown.’</p>

<p>‘Pick me up again, I hope,’ replied
the countess, laughing, as if it were an
excellent joke.</p>

<p>‘Yes, but with a broken limb perhaps,
and fancy what my remorse would be if
that happened. I should never forgive
myself for having mounted you on the
beast. But she really is a good-tempered
thing if you know how to take her.’</p>

<p>‘Just like her mistress,’ said Nora, smiling.
‘But, seriously, Ilfracombe, I will be
more careful. I don’t want to break my
leg before I am presented at Court.’</p>

<p>‘Nor after it, I hope, my darling. But
walk Leila now, there’s a good child,
and let her simmer down a little. You’ve
made me feel just as I do when I think
I’ve missed the odd trick.’</p>

<p>‘I believe you are fonder of playing
cards than anything, Ilfracombe,’ said Nora
slowly.</p>

<p>‘I <span class="lock">am—except</span> you. But they are so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
jolly—there’s so much excitement about
cards. They keep a man alive.’</p>

<p>‘But, Ilfracombe, why need we always
play for such high stakes? Do you know
I lost thirty pounds at “Sandown” yesterday
evening?’</p>

<p>‘Did you, dearest? Are you cleaned
out? I will let you have some more as
soon as we reach home.’</p>

<p>‘No, it is not that. It would not signify
once in a way perhaps, but it is the same
thing every night. It seems an awful
waste of money.’</p>

<p>‘Not if you enjoy it, dear. We must
pay for our whistle, you know. Cards
would be no fun without the stakes. And
somebody must lose.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, and somebody must win. Only,
as it happens, it is always the same somebody,
which doesn’t seem fair.’</p>

<p>‘Nora, what do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘Just what I say, Ilfracombe. I lose every
night; so do you; so does Lord Babbage;
and the only person who wins is Mr Portland.
All the money seems to go into his pocket.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, Nora, my darling, this is not
fair of you. You are prejudiced against
my old <span class="lock">chum—I</span> have seen that from the
beginning—but to say that dear old Jack
wins all the stakes, night after night, is
as good as <span class="lock">saying—oh</span>, I am sure you
cannot mean <span class="lock">it—you</span> cannot think of the
meaning of what you say.’</p>

<p>‘My dear Ilfracombe, there is no meaning
about it. I am only speaking the
plain truth. I’ve seen it for a long time.
Doubtless, Mr Portland is the best player
of the four, and that is the reason, but
it has struck me as rather remarkable.
And it seems so strange, too, that friends
should want, or like to pocket each other’s
money. Why can’t we play for the love
of the game? It would be quite as interesting,
surely.’</p>

<p>‘No, no, child, it wouldn’t. Whoever
heard of such a thing as grown men
sitting down seriously to play for love?’
cried the earl merrily; ‘that’s only
schoolgirl’s games. And I wonder to
hear you, Nora, who are such a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
woman of the world, suggesting such a
thing. I should have thought you liked
staking your money as well as anyone.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps it is because I am a
woman of the world that I don’t
like to see my husband’s money wasted.
No income, however large, can stand
such a strain long. Besides, I know it is
not only cards on which you bet with
Mr Portland. You go to races with
him, and lose a lot of money there. Mr
Castelton told me so!’</p>

<p>‘It is not true, Nora, and Castelton
had better mind his own business. Everybody
must lose occasionally; but I always
follow Jack’s lead, and he’s as safe as
the church clock. And, after all, my
dear girl, I’d as soon the tin went into
old Jack’s pocket as my own. He’s
awfully hard up sometimes, and if one
can’t share some of one’s good things
with one’s best friend, I don’t know what’s
the use of them.’</p>

<p>‘Well, leave a little for me,’ cried
Nora gaily, and her husband’s answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
should have at least satisfied her that
she would always be his first care. But
she was not satisfied with regard to the
nightly games of cards. She watched
the players more closely after this conversation
than before, and decided within
herself that she had been correct, and
Jack Portland was by far the heaviest
and most frequent winner. One day, when
they were alone together, she could not
help congratulating him, in a sarcastic
manner, on his continual run of good
luck. He guessed at her meaning in a
minute.</p>

<p>‘Do you mean to infer that I cheat?’
he asked her abruptly.</p>

<p>Then Nora felt a little ashamed of
herself and did not know what to reply.</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, of course not. How could
you think of such a thing? Only it is
evident that you are a far better player
than Lord Babbage or Ilfracombe, and,
to my mind, the odds are very much
against them. As for poor me, you
have ruined me already. I have lost all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
my pin-money for the next three
months.’</p>

<p>‘Nonsense!’ he said rudely (Mr Portland
could be exceedingly rude to her
when they were alone), ‘you know you
can get as much money out of Ilfracombe
as you can possibly want. The man is
infatuated with you. More fool he. But
he’ll find out how much your love is
worth some day.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps you intend to enlighten him?’
said her ladyship.</p>

<p>She could not resist letting fly her little
shafts at him, whatever the consequences
might be.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps I do, if you egg me on to
it,’ was Mr Portland’s reply. ‘But, seriously,
my lady, don’t you attempt to come between
his lordship and myself, or you
may rue the day you did it. I am a
<i lang="fr">vaurien</i>—adventurer—swindler—what you
like. I’m not afraid of you or your tongue,
because I hold the trump card and should
have no hesitation in playing it. But my
income, though tolerably expansive, is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
fluctuating one, and I am compelled to
eke it out as best I can. I amuse my
friends, and I live chiefly at their expense.
Lord Ilfracombe is, luckily for
me, one of my best and greatest of chums,
so I cling to him like a double-sweet
pea. Until you came in the way there
has never been a suspicion cast on the
honour of my <span class="lock">intentions—the</span> disinterestedness
of my friendship. See that you
don’t do it, that’s all.’</p>

<p>‘And what if I did?’ asked Nora,
defiantly, with her head well up in the air.</p>

<p>Mr Portland moved a few steps closer to her.</p>

<p>‘I would deliver those letters of yours
into Ilfracombe’s hands within the hour,’
he said, between his teeth.</p>

<p>Nora quailed before his glance, but her
voice was steady as she replied,—</p>

<p>‘You would not. You <em>dare</em> not. You
would ruin yourself for ever, and be pointed
at in Society as a scoundrel and a black-mailer.’</p>

<p>‘Never mind what the world would say
of me. Think only of what it would say
of <em>you</em>.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>‘It could not say anything,’ she retorted,
with the boldness of despair; ‘there
would be nothing for it to say. There
is no harm in those letters. I should
not mind if my husband read them
to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘Wouldn’t you?’ said Jack Portland, with
open eyes. ‘Then I’ll show them to him
before he is twelve hours older.’</p>

<p>‘No, no,’ said Nora quickly, ‘you
would not do so mean an act, surely.
You must have some instincts of a gentleman
left in you. Remember under what
circumstances they were written, and that
I thought at the time I loved you.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose you did,’ replied Mr Portland;
‘but they are delicious reading all the
same. I read passages from them once
to a select party of my men friends,
and they said they would never have
guessed they were the productions of a
young lady. They voted they would have
been warm even from a barmaid.’</p>

<p>‘You did not! You cannot have been
such a blackguard!’ exclaimed Lady Ilfracombe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
so shrilly, that he laid his hand
upon her arms to caution her she might
be overheard. ‘You have promised to
give me those letters back, over and
over again, and you have not kept your
word. I will wait no longer, but have
them at once. I insist upon it. Do
you hear me? I will stand this treatment
from you no longer.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I hear, fast enough, and I’m
very much afraid that everybody else in
the house, including Lord Ilfracombe, will
hear also, if your ladyship is not a little
more guarded.’</p>

<p>‘But you <span class="lock">promised—you</span> <em>promised</em>,’
she continued vehemently, ‘and now you
threaten to break your promise. You
are no gentleman, Mr Portland. The
lowest man on earth would degrade himself
by such vile conduct.’</p>

<p>‘I daresay,’ he answered coolly; ‘perhaps
he would. But your behaviour is
enough to make a saint forget his natural
instincts. You remind me that I promised
to return your letters. I know I did,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
and if you had treated me decently since
coming here, I might have kept my
promise. But I won’t give them to you
now. I will only sell them.’</p>

<p>‘What can you possibly mean?’ exclaimed
the countess. ‘Am I to buy back
my own letters? Well, I will. What
price do you ask for them?’</p>

<p>She was standing in the oriel window of
the drawing-room, most becomingly dressed
in a gown of brown velvet, that seemed to
match her eyes and set off the pearly whiteness
of her skin, and as she put the above
question she curled her upper lip and threw
such an air of disdain into her expression
that she looked more charming than usual.</p>

<p>‘Don’t look like that,’ said Portland,
coming nearer to her, ‘or you will aggravate
me to kiss you.’</p>

<p>The indignant blood rushed in a flood
of crimson to Nora’s face and forehead,
until it nearly forced tears from her eyes.</p>

<p>‘How dare you! How dare you!’ she
panted, as she retreated as far as she
could from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>‘How dare I?’ he repeated. ‘That
wasn’t the way your ladyship used to
receive the same proposition when we
sat together under the shade of the
orange-trees in Malta a couple of years
ago. Was it now?’</p>

<p>‘I do not know. I cannot remember.
I only know that your presence now is
hateful to me. What sum do you
require for those letters? If it was half
our fortune I would give it you, sooner
than be subjected to further insult. Tell
me how much at once. I will sell all
my jewels if I cannot raise the money
otherwise!’</p>

<p>‘No, no, I’m not going to press you
quite so hard as all that, Nora. I
don’t want your jewels, my dear,’ replied
Jack Portland, with offensive familiarity.
‘My price <span class="lock">is—your</span> silence.’</p>

<p>‘Silence about what? Do you imagine
I am likely to talk about a matter
which I would expunge with my lifeblood
if I could.’</p>

<p>‘You mistake me. By your silence, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
mean that you must no longer interfere,
as you seem inclined to do, between
your husband and myself. You must
not try to separate us in any way;
not in our friendship, nor our pursuits,
nor our sports; we like to play cards
together—’</p>

<p>‘<em>You</em> like, you mean,’ she interposed
sarcastically.</p>

<p>‘<i lang="fr">Plait-il</i>,’ acquiesced Jack Portland,
with an expressive shrug; ‘at anyrate,
we have been used to play cards and
attend races and generally enjoy ourselves
as <i lang="fr">bons camarades</i>, and your ladyship
will be good enough not to attempt
to put an end to these things, not to
remark in that delicately sarcastic way
of yours that it is always your humble
servant who appears to win. Do I
make myself perfectly understood?’</p>

<p>‘Perfectly,’ said Nora, ‘and if I consent
to this, what then?’</p>

<p>‘Why, that packet of charming letters—twenty-five
in all, if I remember rightly—which
have afforded me so much consolation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
under our cruel separation, and
which would prove, I feel sure, such very
interesting reading for Lord Ilfracombe,
shall remain in my custody, safe from
all prying eyes except mine.’</p>

<p>‘But you promised to return them to
me,’ argued Nora, and then with the
greatness of the stake at issue before
her eyes, and forgetting everything but
that she was at the mercy of the man
before her, the unhappy girl condescended
to entreaty. ‘Oh, Mr <span class="lock">Portland—Jack</span>,’ she
stammered, ‘for God’s <span class="lock">sake—for</span> the sake
of the past, give me back those letters.’</p>

<p>‘How nice it is to hear you call me
“Jack,”’ said Mr Portland, gazing boldly
at her. ‘It almost reconciles me to the
great loss I experienced in you. When
you call me “Jack” I feel as if I could
refuse you nothing.’</p>

<p>‘Then will you give them to me?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly, <i lang="fr">ma chère</i>, haven’t I said
so a dozen times? Only you must
positively wait until I return to town.
You women are so terribly unreasonable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
And you, for your part, promise never
to interfere between my old friend
Ilfracombe and myself, and sometimes,
to call me “Jack” for the sake of the
past.’</p>

<p>Lady Ilfracombe was shivering now as
if she had received a cold-water douche.
She realised what being in the power
of this man <span class="lock">meant—that</span> he would torture
her, as a cat tortures a mouse, until he
had bent her in every way to do his
will.</p>

<p>‘I promise,’ she said in a low voice;
‘but if you gentlemen will play for such
high stakes, you must not expect me to
join your game. You would ruin me
in no time; as it is, I am regularly
“cleaned out.”’</p>

<p>‘I would much rather you did <em>not</em> join
it,’ replied Mr Portland seriously. ‘Ladies
are seldom any good at whist, and I
would rather play dummy any day. I
suppose Ilfracombe will take you to
Newmarket and Epsom with him, but
you will understand nothing of the races,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
so I make no objection to that. By the
way, have you yet mentioned this matter
of our playing high to him?</p>

<p>‘I told him I thought the stakes were
high for a private game, but he contradicted
me, and said it was no fun
playing except for money.’</p>

<p>‘I should think not. However, don’t
speak to him of such a thing again
please. Besides, it is ridiculous. He has
an ample fortune, and can afford to do
as he pleases. I can’t see myself why
you sit in the card-room in the evenings,
the drawing-room is the proper place for
a lady.’</p>

<p>‘You would like to separate me from
my husband altogether, I daresay,’ cried
Nora heatedly.</p>

<p>‘By no manner of means. You quite
mistake my meaning. Such a proceeding
would distress me beyond measure. But
I don’t intend to give up any of the
privileges which I enjoyed from Ilfracombe’s
intimacy before his marriage for
you. Had he married anybody else, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
might have been different, but not for
<em>you</em>. It would be too bad to ask me
to give up both my lady-love and my
friend at one stroke. You will acknowledge
the justice of that yourself, won’t
you?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t ask me, I don’t know anything,’
replied the Countess, wearily, as
she moved away, ‘You have come into
my life again to make it miserable, and
if you have no honour nor generosity there
is nothing left that I can see to appeal to.’
And in her heart Nora added, ‘And if
I could stretch you dead at my feet
this moment, I would do it without a
single pang.’</p>

<p>She was more cautious in what she
said to the earl, however, after that, and
occasionally he rallied her on having got
over her objection to too high play.
Once when they were quite alone, she
ventured to answer him.</p>

<p>‘No, Ilfracombe, I cannot say that
you are right. You must have observed
that I seldom stay in the room now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
when you are playing, I do not approve
of such high stakes, but I do not like
to interfere with your enjoyment, or to
appear to know better than yourself.
But you won’t tell Mr Portland I said
so,’ she added in a wistful tone. Lord
Ilfracombe looked surprised.</p>

<p>‘Tell Jack, my darling? Why, of
course not. All that passes between
you and me is sacred. I don’t think
you’ve been looking quite up to the
mark lately, Nora. I’m afraid you must
find Thistlemere rather dull. I shall be
glad when the time comes for us to go
up to town. Then we’ll see some life
together, won’t we?’</p>

<p>And Nora smiled faintly, and answered
‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Derby was run that year in the
last week of May. The young Countess
of Ilfracombe had already been presented
at Court under the auspices of her
mother-in-law. She had attended more
than one Royal function since; she had
seen all that there was worth seeing in
town, and she had entertained largely
at her own house in Grosvenor Square.
She had been fairly launched on Society
in fact, and, unlike most heroines, it had
not disappointed her. Everything was
new and fresh to her; everything was
delightful. This was what she had longed
for and dreamed of in far-off Malta,
and her letters home were full of the
pleasure she was experiencing and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
honours that were paid to her. Nora
felt happier, too, and more at her ease
in the company of her mother-in-law and
the Ladies Devenish, and away from
the close, every-day companionship of
Mr Portland, who had at last returned to
his own chambers in the Albany. She
fluttered about from milliner to milliner,
theatre to theatre, like a huge butterfly;
all fashion, delicate tints, smiles and excitement.
Ilfracombe, unlike his usual
taste, seemed delighted to be her cavalier
on all occasions. The truth is, he was
thankful to get out of the house. Fond
as he undoubtedly was of his wife, the
atmosphere of Grosvenor Square depressed
him. He could not enter a single room
without being painfully reminded of Nell
Llewellyn and her devoted love for him.
It had been a very real love between
these two. On her side the most unselfish,
adoring, humble <span class="lock">passion—on</span> his,
a very appreciative acknowledgment of
her single-eyed affection, mingled with a
great admiration of her beauty. <em>His</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
love for her, however, had always been
mixed with a certain amount of shame
and uncertainty, because he knew it was
impossible it could go on for ever, and
he dreaded the moment when it would
become imperative to tell her so. Nell
had ended it all for herself, however, and
but too abruptly, and now he could not sit
in the rooms where they had for so long
sat together, and which she had so confidently
regarded as her own without
finding his thoughts very much drawn
her way, even though his lawful wife
was by his side. He thought of the
time when Nell first came to his house,
a tall, slender girl, with a complexion like
a wild rose, and beautiful startled hazel
eyes, moist with the dews of youth. How
frightened she was when he first whispered
his love into her <span class="lock">ear—how</span> passionately
remorseful when he had led
her <span class="lock">astray—how</span> wonderfully grateful
and reverential when he told her she
should thenceforth reign the mistress of
his heart. He looked back over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
years she had managed his household for
him, and could not remember one instance
of her losing her temper with him—that
passionate, indomitable temper, which
was so quickly roused by others. How
often he had wished, almost decided
to make her his wife, if only for the
devoted love she bore him, but had been
afraid on consideration of the sneers
and disapproval of the world, and so had
dismissed the idea from his mind. And
now—well, of course, he would not
change his Nora for any woman. She
was a glory to him, whilst poor Nell
would only have been a disgrace. Still
he wished from the bottom of his heart
that she had been more reasonable, and
gone home quietly to her friends, and,
by-and-by, married some man in her own
station of life, who would have considered
the settlement he wished to make on her
a little fortune. Lord Ilfracombe wondered,
by the way, who <em>were</em> Nell’s friends,
and where she came from. She had
never mentioned her old home to him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
Did they know of her sad death, he
wondered; or of the circumstances that
led to it? He thought not. She was
not the sort of woman to betray the
man she loved even in death. She would
have carried her secret with her to the
grave. It was done, and it could not
be undone, he would tell himself, but
the thought made the house very
distasteful to him. He became nervous,
even timid. He did not care to enter
his private rooms at dusk, and would
fancy he heard a sigh, or caught sight
of a shadowy form flitting by him in
the gloaming. One day he called his
wife ‘Nell.’ It was a fearful mistake, and
his face grew crimson as he discovered
it; but Nora was wonderfully calm under
the little <i lang="fr">désagrément</i>.</p>

<p>‘Was that Miss Llewellyn’s name,
Ilfracombe?’ she asked archly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, my love, forgive me!’ cried
the earl. ‘What can I have been thinking
of? It was the mere force of
habit. You know she was here with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
me, and it is the first time I have
been in the house since.’</p>

<p>‘Did you think I should be angry?’
asked Nora, looking back at him over
her shoulder. ‘Surely it is the most
natural thing in the world that you
should think of the poor girl. You
would be a brute if you didn’t; but don’t
get melancholy over it, dear boy. Come
into the Park with me, or let us go
down the river together. I won’t leave
you moping here by yourself.’</p>

<p>And it was such things that made
Lord Ilfracombe say, and rightly, that
he had gained a wife in a thousand.
He was anxious that she should accompany
him to the Derby, for two
reasons—anxious that she should see
the biggest race of the year, which, of
course, she had never yet had an opportunity
of doing; and anxious to let the
racing world see what a charming
countess he had secured. The Dowager
Lady Ilfracombe was very much
against the idea, and the Ladies Devenish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
said it was decidedly vulgar and not at
all <i lang="fr">comme il faut</i>.</p>

<p>‘If Ilfracombe had taken you to
Ascot, or Goodwood, it would have been
different, but the Derby! Why, hardly
any ladies go there. There is always
such a vulgar crowd, and, coming back
by the road, you are bound to be insulted.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think so?’ said Nora. ‘I
should like to see the man who would
dare to insult me in Ilfracombe’s presence.’</p>

<p>‘But you don’t know anything about
it,’ replied Lady Blanche. ‘The roughs
who frequent the Derby course make no
difference between an earl and anybody
else. They don’t know one when they
see him, and the awful people you will
see on the race-course, <span class="lock">gipsies—and</span> nigger
minstrels, and low creatures of all
sorts.’</p>

<p>‘Have you ever been there yourself?’
inquired Nora.</p>

<p>‘I should hope not, indeed. I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
not think of such a thing. It is no place
for ladies. I can’t imagine what Ilfracombe
can be thinking of to let you go.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I suppose he knows better
than either of us, Blanche, and it was
his own proposal. We are going down—a
large party on our drag. Lady Moberly
and the Duchess of Downshire are going
with us, so I shall offend the proprieties
in good company.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, if the duchess is going with you,
it makes a difference of course. No one
has ever said a word against the duchess,
and she is at least fifty, so she will give
a tone to the whole affair and be a sort
of chaperon for you; for you see, Nora,
though you <em>are</em> a countess, you are rather
young.’</p>

<p>‘I know that,’ retorted Nora; ‘but
I’m getting the better of it every day.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you needn’t be flippant, my dear,’
replied her sister-in-law with a sniff. ‘Rank
has its obligations, though you do not
appear to think so. There might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
been some excuse for your not knowing
it before your marriage, but there is none
now.’</p>

<p>‘No, I suppose not. All the same I’m
going to the Derby this year, if I never
go again.’</p>

<p>And off ran Nora to join her husband.
The Derby day was for her a complete
success. She was dressed becomingly—was
in good health and spirits, and in the
humour to enjoy all she saw and heard.
Lord Ilfracombe’s drag, with its team of
perfectly-matched chesnuts, was one of
the handsomest in the Four-in-hand Club,
and had always attracted particular attention
when he turned out for the annual
Park display. Their party consisted of
the Duchess of Downshire, Lord and Lady
Moberly, Miss Chetwynd, one of that
season’s beauties, and several bachelors,
amongst whom was Mr Jack Portland—the
only drawback to Nora’s enjoyment.
But she was seated behind her husband
and the duchess, who occupied the box seat,
and he was at the back of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
coach, so that during the journey they
did not exchange a word with one another.
As soon as they arrived on the race-course,
and the horses had been taken
out of the shafts, the servants spread
their luncheon, and they began to have a
merry time of it. Presently Jack Portland’s
voice was heard exclaiming, as he looked
at someone through his field-glass,—</p>

<p>‘By George! if that isn’t Sir Archibald
Bowmant, my Usk friend, and his wife. I
told you, Ilfracombe, didn’t I, that I’m
going to spend a few weeks with them
next month. They’re the best fellows in
the world. Awful fun! and don’t the old
boy know a card when he sees it.’</p>

<p>‘Friends of yours, Jack?’ said Ilfracombe
in his hospitable way. ‘Ask them
to come here and lunch with us, old boy,
if they’re not better engaged.’</p>

<p>‘Shall I? Have I <em>your</em> permission,
Lady Ilfracombe?’ asked Mr Portland,
looking at Nora.</p>

<p>‘Need you ask the question, Mr Portland,’
she replied without glancing his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
way. ‘If you have my husband’s leave,
you have mine.’</p>

<p>‘Thanks,’ said Mr Portland as he descended
from the coach. ‘They may be
with another party; but I’ll just ask. I’m
sure you’ll like them. Lady Bowmant is
just your style.’</p>

<p>In a few minutes he returned with his
friends, and introduced them to Lord and
Lady Ilfracombe. Sir Archibald was a
stout, florid, middle-aged man, with a jolly,
good-tempered countenance, and weak,
watery, blue eyes. His wife, to whom he
had not been married a twelvemonth, was
many years his junior, perhaps not more
than five-and-twenty, and was as good
a specimen of a fast young woman who
just contrives not to step over the rubicon
as could be found anywhere. She had
been a nobody, and her head was completely
turned by having become the wife
of a baronet. She was decidedly pretty,
with a countrified style of beauty, and
she was fashionably but not well dressed.
Her manner was effusive, and her voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
loud, but she was lively, sparkling and
amusing. Lady Ilfracombe, though indisposed
to accord her a hearty welcome
just because she had been introduced by
Jack Portland, could not help thawing
under her lively manner, and before long
they were all on the most excellent
terms.</p>

<p>‘How good of you to ask us to luncheon,
Lady Ilfracombe!’ exclaimed the new comer.
‘I am sure I shall never forget it. I do
so admire anything like cordiality. You
meet with so little of it in this country.
We Englishwomen are horribly stiff as a
rule, are we not? Sir Archibald and I
were admiring your drag so much. We
were on the course when you drove up,
just making our way to the Grand Stand.
It is quite a wonder we are here. We
never meant to come, but I have never
seen the Derby run, and Sir Archibald
thought I should not go back to Wales
without doing so. We drove down but
put up at the hotel. Are we not ignoramuses?
I was just despairing of pushing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
our way through this crowd when Jack
spied us out, and landed us, through
your goodness, in this haven of
peace.’</p>

<p>‘You have known Mr Portland a long
time then, I suppose?’ remarked Nora.</p>

<p>‘Why? Because I called him “Jack?”
Oh, everyone calls him “Jack,” don’t they?
He’s a regular lady’s man, is Mr Portland,
and a great favourite with my husband.
He is coming to stay with us in
Usk next month.’</p>

<p>‘So he told us just now.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I am quite looking forward to it.
He is such a delightful companion in the
country. Do you like the country, Lady
Ilfracombe? Are you fond of horses?’</p>

<p>‘I am very fond of horses,’ replied Nora,
smiling; ‘but if your question means, Do
you ride well? I must tell you that I never
mounted a horse till after my marriage, and
so I am still a learner.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, you’ll be proficient in no time!’
exclaimed Lady Bowmant. ‘Isn’t it delightful?
I adore riding and driving, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
everything connected with horses. Don’t
I, Sir Archibald?’</p>

<p>‘You do, my dear,’ said the jolly baronet.
‘That is, if adoring means riding them to
death, and driving over half my tenantry,’
and he roared as if his wife’s feats of skill
were the funniest things in the world.</p>

<p>‘Now, don’t tell tales out of school, Sir
Archibald,’ cried the lady. ‘You know
when I hunted last season that there
wasn’t a woman in the field who could
keep anywhere near me. And didn’t I
carry off three brushes? And didn’t the
master of the fox-hounds say I was the
pluckiest horsewoman he had ever seen?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes, Dolly; no one denies your
pluck, my dear. Only I wish you didn’t
drive your tandem over the children so
often. The pounds I had to pay last year
for mending babies and recouping the
mothers passes belief.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t you believe him, Lady Ilfracombe,’
said his wife with a saucy nod.
‘The old man’s getting in his second dotage
and doesn’t know half he says.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>At this fresh sally Sir Archibald roared
again until he nearly choked himself over
his lobster salad and champagne.</p>

<p>The races were now beginning in good
earnest, but Nora did not take half so much
interest in them as she did in the lively
conversation of her new acquaintance, who
out-talked the duchess and Lady Moberly
and all the other ladies put together.
She was very keen on the racing though,
and explained a great deal to Nora which
she could not have understood without her.
The gentlemen of the party had left the
drag as soon as the work of the day began,
and found their way to the betting-ring.</p>

<p>‘Now, I hope my old man won’t pop
too much on Caliban!’ exclaimed Lady
Bowmant a little anxiously. ‘For it looks
to me as if he had been a bit overtrained.
I heard Jack recommending him
to put a monkey on him; but though
Jack knows a thing or two I don’t always
take his advice in racing matters. I expect
its six for himself and half-a-dozen
for his friends like most of them, eh?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>‘I know so little of these things,’ replied
Lady Ilfracombe. ‘Is the Derby
a great race for betting on?’</p>

<p>The other turned and looked at her
with surprise.</p>

<p>‘Is the Derby a race for betting on?’
she repeated. ‘My dear Lady Ilfracombe,
men lose fortunes over it. They’re
mad, I tell them, perfectly mad. No one
likes spending money more than I do;
but to throw it away by the thousand!
Why, it spells ruin for the majority, that’s all.’</p>

<p>‘I hope Ilfracombe will not be reckless,’
said Nora anxiously. ‘I sometimes think
he is a little disposed to be so over cards
and those sorts of games.’</p>

<p>‘If he’s with Jack Portland, he’s bound
to “go the pace,”’ returned Lady Bowmant,
laughing. ‘Upon my word, I
sometimes think that man’s mad. Have
you ever seen him at baccarat, Lady
Ilfracombe?’</p>

<p>‘Who? What?’ said Nora, who was
vainly trying to follow her husband’s
movements. ‘Mr Portland? No.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>‘It’s a caution,’ said her companion.
‘I’ve had to positively drag Sir Archibald
away from him sometimes, for fear he
should get up from the table without a
halfpenny. But it’s a lovely game. So
much excitement. We are at it at Usk
Hall sometimes till four in the morning.
We are terrible gamblers up there.’</p>

<p>‘See!’ cried the duchess, standing up
in the drag; ‘they’re off!’</p>

<p>After which they spent a couple of
very fatiguing hours watching the various
races, and jotting down the first, second
and third winners on their cards, during
which time the men did not come near
them, so occupied were they by the
business of the betting-ring and the
excitement provided for them there.
When it was at last all over, and their
party returned to the drag, Nora observed
that Ilfracombe was looking very
flushed, and talking very fast, a sufficiently
unusual circumstance with him to
attract her notice. Mr Portland, on the
contrary, seemed to take things much more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
coolly; whilst the baronet had lost some
of his hilariousness, and Lord Moberly
was congratulating himself that he had
not been persuaded to back the favourite.</p>

<p>‘Well, and how have you all fared?’
cried the duchess gaily, as they came
within hailing distance.</p>

<p>‘Sir Archibald, I feel certain you have
been making a fool of yourself!’ exclaimed
his wife. ‘I can see it in the set of
your tie. Very well. Back you go to
Usk to-morrow, and you’ll have to put
up with mutton and potatoes till we’ve
recouped ourselves. Now, what have you
lost? Out with it!’</p>

<p>‘Nonsense, Dolly, nonsense,’ replied
the baronet, as he tried to evade her
scrutiny. ‘A mere trifle, I assure you;
not worth thinking about. When did you
ever know me make a fool of myself over
races?’</p>

<p>‘Scores of times,’ replied her ladyship
decidedly, as she whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>Nora did not ask any questions, nor
make any remarks, but she gazed at her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
husband in a wistful way as if she would
read from his features whether he had
been lucky or otherwise. Ilfracombe did
not voluntarily look her way; but after a
while he felt the magnetism of her glance,
and raised his eyes to hers. The silent
anxiety he read in them seemed to annoy
him. He frowned slightly, and affecting
unusual hilarity, climbed to his seat and
seized the reins.</p>

<p>‘Now for a good scamper back to
town!’ he exclaimed. ‘We must not let
the riff-raff get ahead of us, or we shall
be smothered in dust. Are you tired,
darling?’ he continued over his shoulder
to his wife; ‘or would you like to go to
the Oaks on Friday? What do you
think of our national race-course and our
national game?’</p>

<p>‘I have been very much amused. I
liked it very much,’ answered Nora in a
conventional manner; but the tone of her
voice did not convey much satisfaction.
But as Ilfracombe and she were dressing
for a big dinner-party, to which they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
engaged that evening, she crept to his side
and asked him shyly,—</p>

<p>‘Did you lose much to-day, Ilfracombe?
I am sure you lost, or you
would have told me the amount of your
winnings. But was it <em>very</em> much?’</p>

<p>‘I was pretty hard hit over “The Cardinal,”’
he answered; ‘but nothing to howl
over.’</p>

<p>‘Why did you take Mr Portland’s
advice?’ she said. ‘He always makes
you lose.’</p>

<p>‘Not at all,’ replied her husband;
‘Jack is the best adviser I have. Everyone
must lose at times. It’s absurd to
suppose you can always win.’</p>

<p>‘Then why doesn’t he lose also?’ said
Nora boldly. ‘Why doesn’t he give you
the same advice he follows himself?’</p>

<p>‘My darling child, you know nothing
of such matters, and I don’t want you to
do so. They concern men only. And
look here, <span class="lock">Nora—I</span> don’t want to say
anything unkind; but I would rather you
did not interfere with my winnings or my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
losings. They are essentially my own
affair. Trust me to take care of myself.
And now, if you are ready, we had better
go.’</p>

<p>After which Nora was sharp enough to
see that she would only make a bad
matter worse by attempting to set Ilfracombe
against Jack Portland, and that
her only plan was to watch and wait,
until the time came when she might be
able to influence her husband openly.</p>

<p>He loved her, but he was too easily
led by a stronger mind than his own,
and he was too loyal to believe that his
intimate friend, who shared all his good
things at his pleasure, could plot to
aggrandise himself at his expense.</p>

<p>She had brought it on herself, Nora
said inwardly, and she must bear the
penalty as best she might.</p>

<p>A few days after the Derby, Sir
Archibald and Lady Bowmant called upon
her, and she returned their visit. She
thought Lady Bowmant very clever and
amusing, but she little dreamt the acquaintanceship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
would lead to a close and
sudden intimacy. She was astonished,
therefore, one morning, by her husband
telling her that he had met the baronet
at his club the night before, and that he
had extended a most cordial invitation for
them to go down to Usk Hall during the
time that Jack Portland was to be there.</p>

<p>‘To Usk Hall?’ said Nora, with surprise.
‘But, Ilfracombe, we do not know
the Bowmants sufficiently well to go and
stay with them. I have only seen her
three times in all.’</p>

<p>‘What does that signify?’ replied her
husband. ‘They’re awfully jolly people;
you said so yourself, and Jack says they
keep it up royally at Usk Hall. The
Prince of Huhm-Hessetal is to be there,
and no end of nice people. You’ll receive
a proper invitation from Lady Bowmant
to-morrow or next day, and I see no
reason why we should not accept it.’</p>

<p>‘I thought you had agreed to join your
mother’s party at Wiesbaden,’ said the
countess dubiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, hang my mother’s party!’ exclaimed
Ilfracombe irritably. ‘A lot of old fogies
together. What fun should we get out of
that? I only said something about seeing
her there, just to quiet her. I never meant
to go. Besides, we can go abroad afterwards
if you wish it. But neither of us
have ever seen <span class="lock">Wales—a</span> most beautiful
country, and the Bowmants’ is just the
sort of house to suit us. Lots of horses
for you to ride and drive, and salmon fishing
for me; <span class="lock">and—well</span>, all I can say is,
that I wish to go.’</p>

<p>‘Of course, then, we shall go,’ replied
his wife quietly.</p>

<p>But, when the invitation actually arrived,
she made one more appeal to the earl
to keep her out of the way of Jack Portland.</p>

<p>‘Ilfracombe,’ she said, going to seek
him, with the letter from Lady Bowmant
in her hand, ‘have you quite made up your
mind? Am I really to tell these people
that we will go to Usk Hall and stay with
them?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>‘Of course. Why not? Haven’t we
decided to accept the invitation?’ he demanded.</p>

<p>‘<em>You</em> have, I know, but I feel sure it
will prove a disappointment to both of us.
You will call me silly, but I have such a
presentiment that this visit will end in
some terrible trouble for us. Is it only
fancy, do you think,’ added Nora, with
unusual softness in her voice and manner,
‘or may it not be a warning for us not
to go?’</p>

<p>‘A warning! Rubbish!’ exclaimed the
earl, as he kissed her troubled eyes. ‘Now,
my darling, you <em>shall</em> go if only to prove
what a little goose you are. <em>A warning!</em>
I know what you’re thinking of. You’re
afraid I shall succumb to the charms of
the fascinating Lady Bowmant. Well, she
is a flirt, there is no doubt of that, and
she is setting her cap at me rather hard;
but don’t be afraid, little woman. Your
husband is not such a fool as he looks,
and he means you to go with him to

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">So</span> Lady Ilfracombe gave in with a good
grace, and the note of invitation was duly
answered and accepted. It was a proof
of Nora’s growing interest in the earl,
that she had quite left off trying to wield
her power over him in little things. It
was not in her nature ever to sink down
into a very submissive <span class="lock">wife—a</span> meaningless
echo of her husband, water to his wine;
but she was learning to yield her own
wishes gracefully in deference to his, and
in this instance, as we know, she was too
much afraid of Jack Portland to press the
point. He had told her plainly that if she
interfered between him and Lord Ilfracombe,
she would do it at her cost, and
from what she had heard of the <i lang="fr">ménage</i> at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
Usk Hall, both from its owners and himself,
she felt pretty sure their invitation
had been sent at Mr Portland’s instigation,
and that he had a purpose in having it
sent. He was not satisfied with having
fleeced her husband all through the winter,
he would drain his pockets still further at
the Bowmants; in fact, she had no doubt
now that he looked to the earl as the chief
means of his subsistence. And till she had
found some way of outwitting him—until
she had that packet of letters, the contents
of which she so much dreaded her husband
seeing, in her own hands, Nora said to
herself, with a sigh, that she must endure
Mr Portland’s insolence and chicanery.
They had only been asked to the Hall
for a week or two, and they intended to
limit their visit to a week. If she could
only have foreseen what that week would
bring forth. It was a notable fact that
Jack Portland had never tried to rouse
the countess’s anger or jealousy by an
allusion to Nell Llewellyn and her former
influence over the earl. Indeed, he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
not even mentioned her name before Nora.
The reason of this was, not because he
respected her wifehood or herself, but because
the remembrance of Nell was a
sore one with him. He had never cared
the least bit for Miss Abinger. He had
thought her a very jolly sort of girl, with
plenty of ‘go’ in <span class="lock">her—a</span> great flirt—very
fast—very smart, and slightly verging
on the improper. She was a great source
of amusement to him whilst he stayed in
Malta, and he had encouraged her in all
sorts of ‘larks,’ chiefly for the fun of seeing
how far she would go. When their
conduct had commenced to give rise to
scandal in Valetta, and his sister, Mrs
Loveless, had spoken very gravely to him
on the subject, he had sought to make
the <i lang="fr">amende honourable</i> by proposing for
the young lady’s hand. But Sir Richard
Abinger had rejected his suit with scorn.
<em>He</em>—an impecunious adventurer, who lived
from hand to mouth, and had no settled
employment, presume to propose to marry
his daughter Nora, and drag her down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
with <span class="lock">himself—he</span> had never heard of such
a piece of impudence in his life before.
So Mr Jack Portland, having done the
correct thing (as the lady said when she
went to church on Sunday and found there
was to be no service), made haste out of
Malta again, and the place knew him no
more. The rest of the story has been
told. Both of them had only been playing
at love, and neither of them was hurt.
Had it not been for those unfortunately
bold and unmaidenly letters which remained
in Mr Portland’s possession, Nora would
long ago have forgotten all about the
matter.</p>

<p>But there had been something in Nell
Llewellyn, fallen woman though she was,
that had made a much deeper impression
on the heart of Mr Portland, if, indeed, he
possessed such an article. He had not
proposed to marry <span class="lock">her—it</span> was not much
in his way to consider marriage a necessary
accompaniment to respectability; but, had
Nell made marriage a condition of their
union, he would have yielded to her wishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
sooner or later. There was something
about her grand devotion to Ilfracombe
that attracted his worldly nature, that was
used to associate with the most mercenary
of her sex; and when she blazed out at
him in her passionately indignant manner,
repudiating with scorn the idea of his
advances, he admired her still more. He
thought Ilfracombe a fool to have given
up the one woman for the other, but he
would have been the last man to have told
him so. He was not going to kill the
goose that laid the golden eggs. And a
very disagreeable feeling had been engendered
in him by the knowledge of Nell’s
supposed fate. He did not want to mention
her name, nor to think of her after
that. It was a painful reminiscence which
he did his best to drown in the distractions
of cards and wine. Things were in
just this condition when they all journeyed
up to Usk together, and Mr Portland’s
portmanteau and plaids were carried over
to the rooms at Panty-cuckoo Farm. Nell
was like a wild creature after she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
discovered for certain who their owner
was. To meet Mr Portland, of all men
in the world, would seal her fate. Where
could she fly in order to hide herself from
him? what do to avoid the contact of his
presence? She dared not leave the house
for fear of meeting him; she was afraid
even to leave her own room lest he should
have taken it into his head to explore
the dairy or bakehouse. Her mother did
not know what had come to her. She
grew quite cross at last, and thought it
must be the arrival of the grand folks at
the Hall that had made her daughter so
flighty and useless and forgetful.</p>

<p>‘Just as I want all the help you can
give me,’ she grumbled, ‘and it’s little
enough use you are to me at the best of
times, you get one of your lardy-dardy,
high-flier fits on, and go shivering and
shaking about the house, as if you expected
to meet a ghost in the passage
or the cellar. Now, what made you run
away in that flighty fashion just now,
when you were in the middle of doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
the lodgers’ rooms? I went in expecting
to find them finished, and there were
half the things upset and you nowhere.’</p>

<p>‘I thought I heard one of the gentlemen
coming across the grass, and so I
left the room till he should be gone
again.’</p>

<p>‘But why, my lass? They won’t eat
you. They’re both as nice-spoken gentlemen
as ever I see. And you must have
met plenty of gentlefolk up in London
town. It isn’t as if you were a country-bred
girl, and too frightened to open
your mouth. However, if you don’t like
to take charge of the rooms, I’ll do it
myself. But why won’t you go out a
bit instead? Here’s Hugh been over
every evening, and you won’t stir for
him. I hope you are not carrying on
with Hugh for a bit of fun, Nell, for
he’s a good lad as ever stepped, and a
minister into the bargain, and it would
be most unbecoming in you. You must
go for a walk with him this evening,
like a good lass.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>‘Not if I don’t feel inclined,’ replied
Nell haughtily. ‘Hugh Owen has no
right to look aggrieved if I fancy walking
by myself. Men think a deal too
much of themselves in my opinion.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, well, my lass, you must have
your own way; but I hope you won’t
play fast and loose with Hugh Owen,
for you’ll never get a husband at this
rate. I said, when you first came home,
that I’d look higher than him for you,
but you’re not the girl you were then.
You’ve lost more than a bit of your
beauty, Nell, since you had the fever,
and it’s ten to one if it will ever come
back again. And now that father is so
down about the farm rent being raised,
and talks in that pitiful way about leaving
the country, or going to the
workhouse, I think you might go farther
and fare worse, than Hugh Owen.’</p>

<p>‘Very well, mother, I’ll think about
it,’ the girl would say, more to put an
end to the discussion than anything else,
and she would wander away from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
farm, keeping well to the back of the
Hall, and ready to dart off like a hare,
if she saw any chance of encountering
strangers. Whilst Nell was leading this
kind of hide-and-seek life, the festivities
at the Hall were going on bravely. They
began, as the old housekeeper had said,
as soon as breakfast had concluded, and
were kept up till dawn the following
morning. A few hours were certainly
devoted to eating, drinking and sleeping,
and a few more to fishing, riding and
driving; but the intervals were filled with
cards, smoke and drink, till Nora opened
her eyes in astonishment, and wondered if
she had got into a club in mistake for a
private house. Her hostess appeared
quite used to that sort of thing, and
entered into it with avidity. She played
whist or baccarat as well as anyone
there, and could sip her brandy and
soda, and smoke her Turkish cigarette
with the keenest enjoyment. She began
to think that Lady Ilfracombe was rather
slow after a day or two, and, indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
Nora’s fastness, such as it was, looked
quite a tame, uninteresting thing beside
that of Lady Bowmant’s. So she fell
naturally to the company of the other
ladies who were staying there, and her
husband seemed pleased it should be so,
and more than once whispered to her
that the whole concern was ‘a bit too
warm’ for him, and they would certainly
‘cut it’ at the end of the week. All the
same, he played night after night with
his hosts and their guests, and seemed
to be enjoying himself with the best of
them. The other lady visitors, of whom
one or two bore rather a shady character
(though of this fact Nora was entirely
ignorant), were ready to avail themselves
of all the luxuries provided for them, but
that did not deter them from saying nasty
things about Lady Bowmant behind her
back, which struck Lady Ilfracombe as
being particularly ill-bred and ungrateful.</p>

<p>‘My dear Lady Ilfracombe,’ said one
of them to her, ‘you know she was
positively <em>nobody</em>—a grocer’s daughter, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
believe, or something equally horrible; and
this old fool, Sir Archibald, was smitten
by her red cheeks and ringlets, and
married her six months after his first
wife’s death. She is just the sort of
person to take an old dotard’s fancy.
Don’t you agree with me?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I am not sure if I do, Mrs
Lumley,’ replied Nora. ‘I think Lady
Bowmant is exceedingly good-natured, and
no worse in her manners than many
women whom I have met who could
boast of much higher birth. I know
nothing of our hostess’s ancestry, so I
can only speak of her as I find her.’</p>

<p>‘That is not saying much!’ exclaimed
the other, laughing. ‘To see her go on
with that poor Prince of Huhm-Hessetal
is enough to make one die of laughing.
With his broken English, and her attempts
at French, it is as good as a play. And
the open way in which she flatters him.
He will think he is a little god before he
leaves Usk.’</p>

<p>Their ill-nature made Nora better inclined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
than she would otherwise have
been towards the object of it, and she
found that Lady Bowmant, though decidedly
fast and vulgar, was so kind-hearted
and frank with it all, that she could not
help liking her much better than she did
her detractors.</p>

<p>‘I know I’m an awful Goth,’ she would
observe confidentially to Nora. ‘But I
can’t speak a word of French, and I want
this poor prince, who can hardly speak a
word of English, to feel at home with us,
so I “butter” him up as well as I know
how. You see, Lady Ilfracombe, I wasn’t
born to the purple. My father was a
poor <span class="lock">clergyman—ah</span>, you may stare, but
it is an accredited fact that clergymen’s
children are always the <span class="lock">worst—I</span> have
three brothers, the greatest scamps you
ever knew. They ride like devils and
they swear like jockeys; and, if you put
them into a drawing-room, they don’t know
what on earth to do with their arms and
legs, but not one of them would tell a lie
or do a dishonourable action to save his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
life. No more would I. I am quite
aware that I’m not fit to be a baronet’s
wife, but my old man chose me, and so
I do the best I can. And between you
and me and the post,’ continued Lady
Bowmant, laughing, ‘I think, considering
how I was brought up, that I manage
very well. The people down at our place
thought I should eat peas with my knife,
or something pretty of that sort, the first
time I went out to a decent dinner, but
I didn’t, and here I am, you see, with a
real prince for my guest, to say nothing
of you and Lord Ilfracombe. Oh, I’m
afraid to tell you how much I admire
your husband, for fear that you should
think I want to “mash” him; but he
really is <em>too</em> handsome for anything. I
do so love fair men. I told Sir Archibald
yesterday, that if the earl had not been
married, I couldn’t have resisted a flirtation
with him.’</p>

<p>‘Have one now,’ cried Nora merrily.
‘Don’t mind me. It is quite the fashion
for married men to flirt now-a-days; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
a lady in town told me once that she
should feel quite hurt if the women did
not consider her husband worth pulling
caps for.’</p>

<p>‘Now, you’re just the sort of girl I
like,’ said Lady Bowmant admiringly. ‘I
suppose it isn’t good manners to call
you a “girl,” just as if you were nobody.
Still you are younger than I
am, so you must forgive me. You love
horses, too. I can see you’re regularly
plucky by the way you handled my
little mare yesterday, and I should love
to make you as good a whip as
myself. I may say <em>that</em>, you know, for
my brothers and I rode and drove from
little children, and it is the only thing
I can do well.’</p>

<p>‘Except play cards and smoke cigarettes,’
put in Nora slyly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, you think that all very dreadful;
I can hear it from the tone of your
voice,’ replied her good-humoured hostess.
‘But my old man doesn’t mind it, and
he’s the principal person to please, isn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
he? I don’t know what he would do
at Usk, dear old chap! if I couldn’t
take a hand at whist now and then. I
have my horses, you see, but he is
getting a bit too puffy for horse exercise,
so he would be dreadfully dull without
his little game in the <span class="lock">evening—oh</span>, yes,
I know what you are going to say,
Lady <span class="lock">Ilfracombe—and</span> in the mornings,
too. Well, I know it is dreadfully dissipated,
but it has grown into a sort of
habit with us, till we cannot do anything
else. But will you come round the
village for a spin with me in my
tandem? I can show you some beautiful
country, as well as some beautiful
cobs. Sir Archibald has made it the
fashion to deride my tandem, because
once a stupid little child ran right under
the leader’s feet and got a few scratches;
but you must not believe all he says.
Beau and Belle are two little beauties
and I am sure you will not be afraid to
sit behind them.’</p>

<p>‘I am quite sure also,’ replied Nora,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
and she went at once to get herself ready
for the drive.</p>

<p>‘You mustn’t be surprised to see we
are going alone,’ said Lady Bowmant,
as they met again in the hall. ‘I never
take a groom with me unless I intend
calling anywhere. They are no earthly
use, stuck up behind, listening to every
word you say and retailing it in the
servants’ hall. Besides, I never knew
a man do anything for me that I wasn’t
quite as well able to do for myself. So
we’ll have no back seat, if it’s all the same
to you.’</p>

<p>‘Pray don’t alter any of your accustomed
rules for my sake,’ replied the
countess, as they emerged into the open
together.</p>

<p>The dappled-cream cobs were a picture,
with their hogged manes and close-docked
tails. They were as perfectly
matched in appearance as two horses
could possibly be; but their tempers
were the very opposite of one another.
Beau was a darling, or, rather let us say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
he would have been, if Belle would have
let him alone to do his business by
himself. He occupied the shafts, and
stood like a rock, with his forefeet well
planted and his neck curved, and his
eyes looking neither to the right hand
nor the left. But Belle, like most of
her sex, could not leave a man in peace,
and thought it a bad compliment to
herself if he kept steady. So she tossed
her pretty head and neck incessantly,
and threw the foam from her bit, in her
impatience to be off. Lady Bowmant,
who was nothing if she was not a
whip, mounted to her seat and gathered
up the ‘ribbons’ in the most artistic
manner, whilst Nora placed herself beside her.</p>

<p>‘Let go!’ shouted her ladyship, and
off they set, Belle curveting down the
drive as if she were dancing, whilst good
little Beau threw all his soul into his
work, and pulled the dog-cart gallantly
along.</p>

<p>‘Come, that won’t do,’ cried Lady
Bowmant, as she touched up Belle and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
made her do her share; ‘you’re not
going to leave all the hard work to
Beau, miss, not if I know it. Pull up,
like a good girl, and leave off fooling.
‘Aren’t they a pair of darlings?’ she
continued, addressing Nora. ‘I value
them above everything, because they
were one of my dear old man’s wedding
presents to me; but they are
distinctly precious in themselves. Here
we are at the commencement of Usk,
and now you’ll see some fun, Lady Ilfracombe.
See how all the people—boys
and girls, men and <span class="lock">women—fly</span> before
me, tumbling over each other to get out
of my way. I might be King Herod
coming to massacre the innocents, by
the manner they scuttle out of the road.
Whoa, my beauty; there, go gently,
gently, Belle. For heaven’s sake, don’t
kick up any of your shines here, or
they’ll call the policemen. Have you
heard that I have twice been stopped
and once fined for furious driving, Lady
Ilfracombe?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>‘No, indeed, I haven’t,’ replied Nora,
who was enjoying the fun immensely.</p>

<p>On they flew through the village and
out on the open road, the cobs having
now settled seriously to their work, and
skimming over the ground like a pair of
swallows.</p>

<p>When they had driven half the way
into Newport, Lady Bowmant turned
their heads homewards, and trotted them
gently up a long hill. She had them so
completely under her control, that it was a
pleasure to see her handle the reins and
guide them with a flick of her whip.</p>

<p>‘I’d give anything to drive as you
do,’ said Lady Ilfracombe, with genuine
admiration of the prowess of her companion.
‘I should not be afraid whatever
happened whilst you had the reins.’</p>

<p>Lady Bowmant looked pleased, but she
answered lightly,—</p>

<p>‘Dear me, it is nothing, only practice.
I bet you could manage them quite as
well as I do if you tried. They are
thoroughly well trained, you see, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
that’s half the battle; and they are
thoroughbred into the bargain. You can
do twice as much with a well-bred horse
as you can with an outsider. Their
mouths are like velvet. You could guide
them with a bit of string; and as for
their jumping about a little, that’s only
their fun, you know; there’s no vice in it;
in fact, there’s not a grain of vice between
the two of them. I don’t know
what I should do without the darlings.
They are the very joy of my life.’</p>

<p>At this juncture they came across a
cottage, which seemed to recall something
to Lady Bowmant’s mind.</p>

<p>‘By the way,’ she exclaimed suddenly,
‘I wonder how Phil Farley is, or if the
poor old man is still alive. He used to
be a <i lang="fr">protégé</i> of mine last summer, and I
often visited him; but I have quite
forgotten to ask after him since my
return. Would you mind my jumping
down for a minute, Lady Ilfracombe? I
<em>should</em> like just to inquire how the old
man is.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>‘Of course not,’ said her companion
cordially.</p>

<p>‘You will hold the reins for me? You
will not be afraid of them?’</p>

<p>‘Not in the least,’ cried Nora, as she
took the ribbons from Lady Bowmant’s
hands. ‘Don’t hurry yourself on my
account. I shall not mind waiting for
you at all.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you so much,’ replied her
hostess, as, after having stroked the necks
of her horses, and kissed their noses, she
disappeared into the cottage.</p>

<p>Nora was rather pleased to be left
in sole charge. She had been longing
to have a turn at the cobs herself. She
had been watching Lady Bowmant’s actions
very closely, and noticed with what ease
she guided the little <span class="lock">horses—how</span> quickly
they obeyed her voice and the touch of
her hand; and had been wishing all
the time to try driving them. She had
never handled a tandem in her life before,
but she was a plucky girl, and her very
ignorance made her bold. So, as soon as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
Lady Bowmant had disappeared under the
low roof of the cottage, she gathered up
the reins, and gave the leader a slight
flick with her whip. Belle felt the difference
of the hands at once; she was
not used to that sort of thing. The lash
of the whip had fallen on her hind
quarters, and she threw out her heels
at once, and struck her stable companion,
Beau, full in the face. Beau resented
the action; he felt he hadn’t deserved it
of Belle, the best part of whose work he
had taken on himself all the morning;
so he swerved a little aside, and then
broke into a smart trot, which the coquettish
Belle soon persuaded him to change
into a canter, and in another moment,
before their driver knew what they were
after, the pair were tearing off in the
direction of their stables as fast as ever
they could lay their feet to the ground.
Nora tugged and tugged at the reins
without producing the slightest effect on
them. She was very inexperienced, but
she could not help seeing that the cobs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
were running away, and altogether beyond
her control. She grew very pale;
but she held on to the reins like grim
death, and just managed to steer them
clear of a donkey-cart which they
seemed disposed to take in their stride.
She began already to wonder what she
should do when they came to the drive
gates of Usk Hall, which curved sharply
round to the left. They would assuredly
bolt through them, she thought, and
upset the dog-cart, in all probability,
against the postern of the gate. Perhaps
they would kill her from the collision
and the fall. The thought that flashed
through her mind at that juncture was,
How would Ilfracombe take the news of her
death?—what would he do without her?</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid I’m in for it,’ she said to
herself. ‘It’s all up a tree with me. I’m
bound for kingdom come, as sure as a
gun.’</p>

<p>Even at that moment of danger Nora
could not be sentimental, though she felt
the force of the situation perhaps as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
much as if she had been praying to
heaven to avert her doom. On flew the
cobs through the village, though fortunately
without running over anybody, and
down a narrow lane, on the way to the
Hall. There was a sharp curve about
the middle of it. As Nora reached the
point, <span class="lock">someone—a</span> <span class="lock">woman—suddenly</span> rose
from the bank which skirted the road, and
stood full in the way of the flying steeds,
catching with her hand at the reins of
Belle as she passed. Nora thought the
horses were stopped, but the next moment
they started off again; but the woman
was not to be <span class="lock">seen—she</span> had fallen.</p>

<p>‘My God,’ thought Nora, ‘I have
killed somebody. They have run over
her.’</p>

<p>The arrest, however, slight as it was, had
had its effect. Belle and Beau suddenly
stood still as rocks, and Nora leapt at
once from the cart and approached the
stranger, who was just scrambling to her
feet.</p>

<p>‘Oh, how good, how brave of you!’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
she cried. ‘If you had not done that,
they might have dashed the cart and me
to pieces against the gate. But have you
hurt yourself? Are you sure you are all
right?’</p>

<p>‘I think I am,’ replied the young
woman, as she rose to her feet. ‘They
only knocked me down; the wheels did
not come near me.’</p>

<p>‘Thank God for that!’ cried Nora
earnestly. ‘I should never have forgiven
